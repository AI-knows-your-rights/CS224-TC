All soiled or leaking undergarments (diaper, underwear, etc. ) must be rated mature or adult regardless of whether the character is a juvenile (per section 2. 7. 1) or an adult, per Fur Affinity's rating guidelines in our upload policy, section 1. 1 regarding depictions of bodily waste. 2. 7. 3 Art Style Subjectivity Art is very subjective and certain art styles can sometimes make it difficult to determine the age of a character.
