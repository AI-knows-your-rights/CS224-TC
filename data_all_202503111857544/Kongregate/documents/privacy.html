      <h2>1. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT, HOW WE USE IT & OUR LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING IT</h2>
      <p>When you access, connect to, sign up to, participate in, create an account for, make purchases within or otherwise use
      our Services, we may collect personal data from you. The personal data we collect will depend on the circumstances and
      the Services you are using. The personal data that we may collect about you and the purposes for which such personal
      data will be used, as well as the legal basis for such processing are explained in this section.</p>
      <ol style="list-style: upper-alpha;">
        <li>
          <p><strong>Visiting our Site.</strong> When visiting our Site, our system will automatically collect data and information from the computer system of the terminal
          device accessing the Site. In this connection the following data will be collected for a limited time period:</p>
            <ol style="list-style:lower-roman">
              <li>visited website;</li>
              <li>quantity of data transmitted;</li>
              <li>information about the type and version of the browser used;</li>
              <li>the operating system of the user;</li>
              <li>the IP address of the user;</li>
              <li>the date and time of access; and</li>
              <li>the websites from which the system of the user arrived on our Site.</li>
            </ol>
          <p>
            Such data will be stored in log files of our system. Such data are needed only to analyze any
            malfunctions and will be deleted in approximately 30 days. The legal basis for temporarily storing data in log files
            is Article 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation (<strong>&ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;</strong>). Temporary storage of the IP address for the
            system is necessary for making the Site available to the terminal device of the user. For this purpose, the IP address
            of the user must be stored for the duration of the session. Data is stored in log files to ensure the functionality of
            our Site. In addition, such data is used to optimize the Site and to ensure the security of our IT systems. Data will
            not be analyzed for marketing purposes in this connection, and we will draw no inferences as to your identity. The
            aforementioned purposes also provide the basis of our legitimate interest in data processing within the meaning of
            Article 6(1)(f) of GDPR. Collecting data to make available the Site and storing data in log files is necessary for
            operating the Site. Consequently, users have no right to object to the collection or use of such data for the
            aforementioned purposes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Communication via Email and Phone.</strong> If you communicate with us via email or telephone, we process all personal data you disclose to us during our
          conversation (e.g., you name, email address, telephone number, the reason why you are contacting us etc.). If you ask
          for help from our customer support team, we will collect and store the contact information you give them (generally,
          your name and email address) as well as information about your game play or activity on our Services, and your
          Kongregate username and/or social network ID number. Recipients of the processed personal data are our respective
          internal employees that are responsible for pursuing our purposes for the processing (e.g., someone from a department
          that you are contacting with a request).</p>
  
          <p>Depending on the specific conversation with you, the personal data can either be processed in order to take steps at
          your request prior to entering into a contract with us or to perform a contract you have concluded with us. In these
          cases, the legal basis for processing the personal data is Article 6(1)(b) of GDPR. Also, the processing can be necessary
          for us to comply with legal documentation obligations. Then, the legal basis for processing the data is Article 6(1)(c)
          of GDPR. The processing can also be necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interest to respond to mails and calls
          of yours when you contact us and are not our contractual partner as well as to have proof regarding substantial content
          of our conversation, including but not limited to cases of potential legal claims on our or your side. We may also store
          the communications you have with the Customer Support team in order to provide you support and improve the Services. The
          legal basis for processing the data in those cases is Article 6(1)(f) of GDPR.</p>
  
          <p>The data is stored at least for the time until our contract with you is fully performed. If the data has been stored in
          order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with us, we will store the data for as long as
          reasons objectively exist to believe that the respective conversation will be continued within the foreseeable future.
          Storage may also take place if this has been provided for by legal regulations such as directives, laws or other
          regulations to which the controller is subject. Data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed by
          the aforementioned standards expires.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Account Information.</strong> When you register for an account (<strong>&ldquo;Account&rdquo;</strong>), we process the following required data of yours: username, email address
          and whether or not you are a Child. Recipients of the processed personal data are our respective employees that are responsible for
          processing the data. We process the required data to enter into and perform a contract with you (Account contract) so
          you can use our Services. The legal basis for processing the data to enter into or perform a contract we concluded with
          you is Article 6(1)(b) of GDPR. Your Account data is stored for as long as you maintain your Account, which can be closed
          anytime at your request. To protect your privacy, your Account will be automatically closed and any such associated data automatically deleted after three (3) or four (4) years of inactivity, as further explained in Section 3.</p>
   </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Information You Provide via Apps.</strong> You may have the option to link your mobile account to your Sites account in
          connection with certain Apps. This will allow you to participate in content that crosses between the Sites and Apps,
          such as Kongregate level, points, and badges. If you choose this linking option, the information we receive via the
          Sites may also apply to Apps, and vice versa.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Purchases.</strong> When you place an order with us through our Platform we will request certain information from you, including,
          your name, email address, payment card details, billing address and phone number. We use a third party payment processor
          for this service. This information will be used to process your order, arrange delivery of your order and correspond
          with you in relation to your order. Recipients of the processed personal data are our respective employees that are
          responsible for fulfilling our Services. Our legal basis for using your personal data in this way is to perform the
          contract we enter into with you and to execute the customer service in respect of your order (Article 6(1)(b) of GDPR).</p>
  
          <p>The data is stored at least for the time until our contract with you is fully performed. If the data has been stored in
          order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with us, we will store the data for as long as
          reasons objectively exist to believe that the respective conversation will be continued within the foreseeable future.
          Storage may also take place if this has been provided for by legal regulations such as directives, laws or other
          regulations to which the controller is subject. Data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed by
          the aforementioned standards expires.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Online Presence in Social Media.</strong> We maintain an online presence on social networks and platforms to communicate with
          clients, interested parties, and users who are active on those networks, and to be able to inform clients, interested
          parties, and users of our Services.</p>
  
          <p>Our Site therefore links to the website of Facebook, operated by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025,
          U.S.A., or, if you reside in the EU, Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2,
          Ireland, (<strong>&ldquo;Facebook&rdquo;</strong>). Otherwise, no data is exchanged with Facebook on our Site. For further information how Facebook processes personal data: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/update">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/update</a>.</p>
  
          <p>Our Site also links to the website of Twitter, operated by Twitter Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco,
          CA 94103, U.S.A. or, if you reside in the EU, Twitter International Company, One Cumberland Place, Fenian Street, Dublin
          2, D02 AX07 Ireland. For further information how twitter processes personal data: <a href="https://twitter.com/privacy">https://twitter.com/privacy</a>.</p>
  
          <p>When you access the aforementioned networks or platforms, the terms and conditions and data processing policies of the
          companies that operate those networks or platforms will apply. Unless otherwise provided in our data privacy policy, we
          will process data of users if they communicate with us through social networks or platforms, e.g., if they post on our
          Facebook pages, or send us messages.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>User-Generated Social Content.</strong> As of January 2022, Kongregate no longer hosts forums or chat rooms. However, if you had posted in a forum prior to January 2022, then your previous posts are still publicly visible. If you had participated in a chat room prior to January 2022, all such chats have been deleted. Any member with an Account may still post game comments, (which are publicly visible), profile shouts and/or direct messages. When you do this, we process your username, date of your post and content of your post. The personal information that you post voluntarily through the Platform may be visible to others.</p>
  
          <p>We process the data to perform a contract with you so you can use our Service. Should you violate our terms of use
          (e.g., post offensive content) we will save such posts to prove the violation. We have a legitimate interest in making
          sure that the rules for participating in our forum are followed and toxic behavior of users can be properly sanctioned
          to ensure a friendly and respectful space for everyone. The legal basis for processing the data to enter into or perform
          a contract we concluded with you is Article 6(1)(a) of GDPR. The legal basis for processing data based on our legitimate
          interest is Article 6(1)(f) of GDPR.</p>
  
          <p>The data is stored at least for the duration of the contract with you. If entitlements to claims arise from the contract
          we store the data for the respective limitation period according to the applicable law. Personal data that is processed
          based on our legitimate interest, will be stored as long as it is covered by such legitimate interest. The storage
          period in such cases is determined by the necessity of the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims (Article
          17(3)(e) of GDPR), e.g., to have proof for a defense against unjustified claims within the respective statute of
          limitations by users who have verifiably violated our terms of use.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Other Information You Provide.</strong> We collect the following types of personally identifiable information: your contact
          information (such as name, postal or email address, or phone number), username and password, purchase history on our
          Platform, game play preferences (such as an interest in a particular type of game or genre), information you provide by
          interacting with us through social media, and photographs that you submit on our Platform or through our social media
          channels. By submitting a photograph, you waive any rights thereto and authorize us to copyright, use and publish the
          same in print or electronically for any lawful purpose.</p>

        <li>
          <p><strong>Information We Automatically Collect.</strong> Kongregate, Kongregate affiliates, and our third-party partners in analytics, user acquisition, and advertising, use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts, to analyze
          trends, administer the Site, track users&rsquo; movements around the Site, and gather demographic information about our user
          base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual or
          aggregated basis.</p>
  
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Analytics.</strong> When you visit our Platform, we automatically collect the following types of information: information about
              the devices you use to access the Internet (such as the IP address and the device, browser, and operating system type),
              URLs that refer you to our Platform and the dates and times of your visits, information on your gaming behavior on our
              Platform (e.g., page views, paths you take through our Sites, frequency of visits, referring/exit pages), general
              geographic location information (e.g., country) that shows where you are when browsing our Sites, search terms that you
              enter to reach our Sites or enter on our Sites to find products, and the fact that you opened one of our emails. We
              utilize analytics services to help us track the efficacy of our Platform and help us learn more about our users&rsquo;
              behavior.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Information We Receive from Third Parties.</strong> As previously noted, you can play Kongregate games through third party
              consoles or third party social media sites such as Facebook. When you play these Third Party Platform Games, backend
              system vendors may collect and share your information with us such as player IDs, session information, and purchase
              data, as well as personal information including email address, gender, and birthday and/or age range. Because such
              services are offered through a third party, this collection of information is governed by the applicable third party&rsquo;s

          to provide customer services, collect debt analysis and improve data and process customer inquiries and perform other
          statistical analyzes. In the performance of these services, the third party vendors may have access to your personal
          data but are only authorized to process it strictly on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Third Party Advertising and User Acquisition Partners.</strong> We have advertising on our Services so we can continue to offer many of our Services for free. Subject to your settings, we provide certain information to advertisers who will use them to serve you with ads in our Platform, and we measure who sees and clicks on their ads. We may also use
          aggregate information to monitor usage of our Services in order to help us improve and develop our Services, and we may provide such aggregate information to third parties, e.g., content partners or advertisers. This aggregate information does not include personal data and cannot be linked to you. When advertisers, ad networks or user acquisition partners place ads in our Services, they may collect or we may share the following types of information from within our Services:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>performance data (like the number of clicks on an advertisement);</li>
            <li>aggregated and/or de-identified information about you and other players collectively that is not intended to
            specifically identify you (like players between the ages of 21 and 25 who live San Francisco);</li>
            <li>certain technical information (for example, IP addresses, non-persistent device identifiers such as IDFAs, and
            de-identified persistent device identifiers such as a hashed Android ID);</li>
            <li>your social network ID;</li>
            <li>and other contextual data about your game play (for example, your level and session length).</li>
          </ul>
  
          <p>The information collected may be used to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>measure how effective ads are, to offer you targeted advertising in order to personalize your experience by showing you
            advertisements for products and services that are more likely to appeal to you (a practice known as behavioral
            advertising), and/or</li>
            <li>undertake web analytics (e.g., Google Analytics which is used to analyze traffic and other player activity to improve
            your experience).</li>
          </ul>
  
          <p>Advertisers or ad networks may collect this information through the use of tracking technologies like browser cookies and web beacons. After clicking on a third party advertisement, you may no longer be on our Platform. The third party
          sites are operated by companies that are outside of our control, and your activities at those sites will be governed by
          the policies and practices of those third parties. We encourage you to review the list of third party advertising and user acquisition partners and their privacy policies before disclosing any personally identifiable information, as we are not responsible for the privacy practices
          of those sites.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Offer Walls.</strong> Our Services may display an “offer wall” that is hosted by an offer wall provider. The offer wall allows third-party
          advertisers to provide virtual currency to players in exchange for interacting with an advertisement or for completing a
          marketing offer that may include signing up for an account with one of those advertisers. After clicking on one of these
          offers, you will no longer be on a site hosted by Kongregate or the social network through which you are playing
          Kongregate games. To properly credit player accounts and to prevent fraud, a unique identifier, in some cases your
          Kongregate username/ID, will be shared with the offer wall provider.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Third Party Developers.</strong> Most of the games on our Platforms are created by third party developers. These third party developers
          may request, by using Kongregate&rsquo;s SDK and APIs, certain publicly visible information about users that play their games, e.g., your username, your user_id (a numeric ID associated with your
          account that persists even if a username is changed) In order to fix bugs. The legal basis of this processing is Article
          6(1)(b) of GDPR.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Third Parties for Security or Other Legitimate Reasons.</strong> We may also disclose your personal data to third parties, if we
          reasonably believe that disclosure of such personal data is necessary:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>to comply with valid legal obligations including subpoenas, court orders, governmental requests or search warrants, and
            as otherwise authorized by law. The legal basis of this processing is Article 6(1)(c) of GDPR.</li>
            <li>to protect our rights, property, or the safety of our customers, employees or the general public.. The legal basis of
            this processing is Article 6(1)(f) of GDPR.</li>
            <li>to protect against fraudulent, malicious, abusive, unauthorized or unlawful use of our Services and to protect our
            network, services, devices and users from such use. The legal basis of this processing is Article 6(1)(f) of GDPR. We
            have an interest in providing our Services without fraud. This interest outweighs the user&rsquo;s interest in not having
            personal data processed.</li>
            <li>to advance or defend against complaints or legal claims. The legal basis of this processing is Article 6(1)(f) of GDPR.
            We have an interest in defending against complaints or legal claims. This interest outweighs the user&rsquo;s interest in not
            having personal data processed.</li>
            <li>to determine credit risk. The legal basis of this processing is Article 6(1)(f) of GDPR. We have an interest to assess
            credit risks in order to protect our economic interest. This interest outweighs the user&rsquo;s interest in not having
            personal data processed.</li>
            <li>or to obtain payment for our Services. The legal basis of this processing is Article 6(1)(b) of GDPR.</li>
            <li>to outside auditors and regulators in case of legal obligations. The legal basis of this processing is Article 6(1)(c)
            of GDPR.</li>

          <p><strong>Corporate Transaction, Reorganization or Bankruptcy.</strong> In the event of a change of control, sale of some or all of our
          business or assets, corporate reorganization or bankruptcy, we would share the pertinent customer information (which may
          include your personal information) with the other business entity (or entities) involved in the transaction. In such an
          event, we would notify you via email and/or a prominent notice on our Platform of any change in ownership or uses of
          your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information. The legal basis of
          this processing is Article 6(1)(f) of GDPR.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Legal Compliance.</strong> We may disclose information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, or when required
          by law to do so. The legal basis of this processing is Article 6(1)(c) of GDPR.</p>

      <h2>3. DATA RETENTION</h2>
      <p>In the following you can find information on how long we store personal data in our systems which we have collected from you during your use of our Services. We adhere to a data retention policy that involves the retention of personal data from active users while concurrently deleting the data of inactive users who satisfy the subsequent criteria:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Annual deletion of user accounts that have not engaged in any form of login activity over the course of at least three consecutive years.</li>

      <h2>4. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
      <p>We strive to maintain the security of your personal information through a variety of security measures. Safeguarding
      your personal data is a priority for us. Personal data that you provide to us is stored on secure servers, and we use
      rigorous procedures to protect against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your
      personal data. Although we work hard to protect your personal data, please note that no system can be guaranteed to be
      100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to employ reasonable protections for your information that are appropriate to
      its sensitivity, we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or
      disclose personal data, and we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of the information you share with us and we
      cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your information.</p>
  
      <p>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to any login or password information, and to your
      computer or device. To minimize the risk of having your account being compromised, we recommend that you set up your
      account password using unique numbers, letters and special characters. Do not disclose passwords to others. Please
      notify us of any password compromises and change passwords periodically to maintain account protection. To learn more
      about how to protect yourself online, we encourage you to visit the government&rsquo;s website at <a href="https://www.onguardonline.gov">www.onguardonline.gov</a>.</p>

      <h2>5. OUR POLICIES CONCERNING CHILDREN.</h2>
      <p><strong>Our Services are Not Designed for Children.</strong> Our Services, Platform and Third Party Platform Games are generally designed
      for and directed at people 18 years of age or older. No one under the age of 13 within the United States (or up to the
      age of 16 for children located in certain European countries)(collectively, <strong>&ldquo;Children&rdquo;</strong>) may provide any personal
      information to us, and we do not knowingly collect information from Children except in connection with the following
      Apps which Kongregate has designated as directed to Children (collectively, our <strong>&ldquo;Children-Appealing Games&rdquo;</strong>).</p>
  
      <p>For our limited collection of Children-Appealing Games, we recognize a special obligation to further protect personal
      information collected from Children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names,
      addresses or phone numbers without permission. Some of the features of our Children-Appealing Games are age-gated so
      that they are not available for use by Children. When we intend to collect personal information from Children, we take
      additional steps to protect children&rsquo;s privacy, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In accordance with applicable law, and our practices, obtaining consent from parents for the collection of personal
        information from their children, or for sending information about our Services directed to Children;</li>
        <li>Limiting our collection of personal information from Children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in
        an online activity; and</li>
        <li>Giving parents access or the ability to request access to personal information we have collected from their Children and
        the ability to request that the personal information be changed or deleted.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For additional information about our practices regarding Children&rsquo;s personal information, please read our <a href="https://www.kongregate.com/pages/childrens-privacy?external-link=true"><strong>Children&rsquo;s
      Privacy Policy.</strong></a></p>
  
      <p>With the exception of a handful or so of our Children-Appealing Games, Children should not attempt to create an account
      or send any of your information to us, including your name, address, telephone number or email address. If Kongregate
      learns that we have collected personal information from Children without verification of parental consent in
      contravention of these measures, we will terminate access to the account immediately and will take all reasonable
      measures to delete such information from its databases and to not use such information for any purpose (except where
      necessary to protect the safety of the child or other as required or allowed by law). If you believe that we might have
      any information from or about Children, please contact us at <a href="mailto: support@kongregate.com">support@kongregate.com</a>.</p>
  
      <p><strong>Right to Remove Posted Information — California Minors.</strong> If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have
      a registered account on the Platform, or through the Third Party Platform Games, you have the right to request removal of
      unwanted information that you publicly post on the Platform, or through the Third Party Platform Games. To request removal
      of such information, you can contact Kongregate using the email address associated with your account at <a href="mailto: support@kongregate.com">support@kongregate.com</a> stating that you reside in California. Upon receiving such a request, Kongregate will make
      sure that the information is not publicly available on our Platform, or through our Third Party Platform Games.</p>

      <h2>6. YOUR RIGHTS AND OPTIONS.</h2>
      <p>We understand that you may at times need further information from us regarding your personal data and how it is
      processed or that you may wish to update or correct the personal data you have provided us with. Your rights under GDPR
      include the following:</p>
      <ol style="list-style: upper-alpha;">
        <li><strong>Right to access your personal data.</strong> You have the right to obtain confirmation from us as to whether or not personal data concerning you are being processed,
        and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and information.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to rectification of personal data.</strong> If you find that personal data that we process about you is inaccurate, you have the right to have us correct such
        personal data.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to restriction of processing.</strong> Under certain circumstances, such as if you question the accuracy of your personal data or you have objected to our
        legitimate purpose to process your personal data, you have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your
        personal data until a solution has been found.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to erasure of personal data (&ldquo;right to be forgotten&rdquo;).</strong> Under certain circumstances, such as if your personal data has been unlawfully processed or you have withdrawn your
        consent (if the processing of your personal data is based on consent), you have the right to request and obtain erasure
        of your personal data from us, subject to certain exceptions. Please also note that any requests for removal do not
        ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information from the Services. For example, content that you
        have posted may be republished or reposted by another user or third party.</li>
        <li><strong>Notification regarding rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing.</strong> We shall communicate any rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing carried to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves
        disproportionate effort. We will inform you about those recipients if you request it.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to data portability.</strong> If your personal data is processed by automated means based on your consent or for the fulfillment of our contractual relationship, you have the right to request that we provide you with your personal data in a machine-readable format for transmission to another data controller.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to object to processing.</strong> Under certain circumstances, such as if you question our legitimate interest to process your personal data, you have the
        right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to such processing.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to revoke the declaration of consent.</strong> You have the right to revoke your data protection declaration of consent at any time. Revocation of your consent does
        not affect the legality of the processing that has taken place on the basis of your consent until revocation.</li>
        <li><strong>We do not use automated decision making processes.</strong> While you would have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing which produces legal effects that similarly significantly affects you, this would not apply for our Platform as we do not use automated
        individual decision-making.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</strong> You have the right to lodge a complaint regarding our processing of your personal data with the supervisory authority of
        your place of residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Discrimination.</strong> At the risk of stating the obvious, we want to be clear that we will not discriminate against you for exercising any of
        your CCPA rights or other privacy rights. Unless permitted by <strong>CCPA</strong>, we will not take any discriminatory actions,
        including, denying you goods or services, charging you different prices or rates for goods or services, including
        through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties; providing you a different level or quality of goods
        or services; or suggesting that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or
        quality of goods or services.</li>

      <p>If our processing of your personal data is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw such consent at any time (this will however not affect the processing based on your consent before its withdrawal) by using this <a href="https://kongregate-privacy.my.onetrust.com/webform/7424cb27-7013-49a6-a5a7-66b4bfa6c20e/167536ab-aa15-479c-8e0f-0b2911ce1d1e"><strong>form</strong></a> or by updating the settings in our Services (where applicable).</p>

We retain and use your information as necessary as described in <strong>&ldquo;Data Retention.&rdquo;</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Opting Out of Promotional Emails from Kongregate.</strong> If you are receiving Kongregate promotional emails due to prior consent and no longer wish to receive those email
        messages, you may opt out at the time you receive the message by following the instructions in that email, clicking on
        the unsubscribe link in our emails or contacting us at <a href="mailto: support@kongregate.com">support@kongregate.com</a>. You will continue to
        receive non-marketing-related emails (e.g., material changes to the privacy policy, issues with the Platform or
        compromised data access).</li>
        <li><strong>Opting Out of App Notifications.</strong> Kongregate Apps may send push notifications to your mobile device to provide game information, news, updates, or other
        relevant information. You can manage these updates from the &ldquo;settings&rdquo; page from within the App or from your device
        control panel that manages these notifications.</li>
        <li><p><strong>Opting Out of Social Media Platform.</strong> If you wish to edit or manage the information Kongregate receives from a social media platform, you need to follow the
        applicable instructions at the specific social media site. For example, Facebook&rsquo;s relevant policy in this regard can be
        found <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/?entry_point=data_policy_redirect&entry=0">here</a>. Please note that once Kongregate receives any personal information from a social media site as a result of a
        user playing Third Party Platform Games, it will be stored and handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Opting Out of Geolocation.</strong> In order to improve and optimize our Service continuously, we use mobile tracking technologies. With the help of these
        services, we collect data on the usage of our Apps to be able to constantly improve our Services. In this respect, we
        may collect: IP address, which is anonymized right away, MAC address, anonymized Device ID (IDentifier For Advertisers
        (IDFA)) or Google Advertiser ID (GAID), browser type, language settings, internet service provider, network status, time
        zone, URL of the entry and exit pages, date of access and time spent, clickstream data, and other statistical
        information about the use of our Services. If you have previously allowed us to access your geolocation data, you can
        stop making geolocation available to us by visiting your mobile device&rsquo;s settings for the relevant application or the
        &ldquo;settings&rdquo; page for the relevant App.</p>
  
        <p>The collection and storing of the data can at any time be disabled with effect for the future as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In the case of an Apple device: Open the settings of your mobile device (e.g. iPhone or iPad) and select the menu item
            &ldquo;Privacy.&rdquo; Under &ldquo;Advertising,&rdquo; you can turn off the Ad Tracking.</li>
            <li>In the case of Android devices: Open the settings in your App list and tap on the &ldquo;Ad&rdquo; button. When the Ad window has
            opened, you can deactivate the Google Advertising ID.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p><strong>Opting Out of Third Party Tailored Advertising.</strong> If you are interested in more information about tailored advertising and your choices to prevent third parties from
        delivering tailored web and mobile web advertising you may visit the following websites:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page</a> or the
            <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Page for U.S.-based advertising</a>; and</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices">Your Online Choices UK website for EU-based advertising.</a></li>
            <li>In addition, if you do not want to receive tailored in-application advertisements from third parties that relate to
            your interests in apps on your mobile device, you may opt-out by adjusting the ad tracking settings on your device. You
            can also reset the &ldquo;Advertising Identifier&rdquo; (like an IDFA) from your mobile device&rsquo;s &ldquo;settings&rdquo; page, which will prevent
            continued use of existing behavioral data tied to the previous &ldquo;Advertising Identifier.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Further, depending on the platform provider (such as Apple or Google), you may be able to download apps, such as
            the Digital Advertising Alliance&rsquo;s &ldquo;AppChoices&rdquo; app, that offer to provide you with control regarding the collection and
            use of cross-app data for tailored advertising.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. While you do have choices to limit personalized ads that are
          tailored to your interests, you may receive generic ads. These opt-out tools are not provided by Kongregate but provided
          by third parties.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Opting Out of Analytics.</strong> We use internal and third party analytics tools, including Google Analytics. The third party analytics companies we work
        with may collect and store data related to our Site, enabling the creation of user profiles under pseudonyms. These user
        profiles serve to analyze visitor behavior and are evaluated in order to improve and design our offer so as to meet the
        demands. Their collection and use of information is subject to their own privacy policies. You may opt-out of Google
        Analytics by following this <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">link</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Controlling Cookies.</strong> In order to design our Services in the most user-friendly manner for you, we, as well as many other companies, also use
        persistent and session cookies and web beacons and other similar technologies. You can manage many companies&rsquo; cookies
        used for online advertising via the consumer choice tools created under self-regulation programs in many countries, such
        as the U.S.-based <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices/">aboutads.info choices</a> page, Canada-based <a href="http://www.youradchoices.ca/">www.youradchoices.ca</a> or the EU-based <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">Your Online Choices</a>. If
        you do not want cookies to be stored on your computer or wish to be informed of their storage, you can prevent the
        installation of cookies by declining to accept cookies or <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/managing/">managing cookies in your web browser</a>. However, we would like
        to point out that by preventing cookies, you may find that you cannot use all of our Platform&rsquo;s functions to the full
        extent. For more information on our <a href="https://www.kongregate.com/pages/cookie-policy?external-link=true">Cookie Policy</a>, please read here.</li>
        <li><strong>Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions.</strong> From time to time, we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests, sweepstakes, surveys and/or other
        promotions on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you as
        provided in the terms of the corresponding promotion. We may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys
        or contests; in those cases, that company will be prohibited from using our users&rsquo; personally identifiable information
        for any other purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>Do Not Track.</strong> Do Not Track is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade
        Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control
        the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. At this time, there is no general
        agreement on how companies such as ours should interpret Do Not Track signals. Kongregate does not currently respond to
        Do Not Track signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or on a mobile device. You can learn more about Do
        Not Track <a href="http://allaboutdnt.com/">here</a>.</li>

    <ol style="list-style: decimal;">
      <li>
        <strong>International Data Transfers.</strong>
        <p>If you are an EU resident, we rely on certain safeguards when sharing your personal data with a recipient established outside of the EEA/EU.</p>
        <p>Some vendors with which we share your personal data are established outside of the European Union. Principally, there are two possible safeguards we can rely on when we share your personal data with these recipients:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;">
          <li>If a recipient is located in a country for which the European Commission has found it provides an adequate level of data protection, we rely on such a decision by the EU Commission. For recipients established in the USA we rely on the Transatlantic Data Transfer Framework, if the recipient is certified under this framework.</li>
          <li>If a recipient is not located in a country with an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission, we either have concluded a contract with this recipient in which we agree on rules to make sure the recipient takes adequate care of your personal data (EU Standard Contractual Clauses developed by the European Commission) or we rely on binding corporate rules of a group of undertakings or enterprises that have been approved by a supervisory authority.</li>
        </ul>

      <li>
        <strong>Information We Collect.</strong><br/>

        <p>The chart below details which categories of Personal Information about California residents we plan to collect, as well as which categories of Personal Information we have collected and disclosed for our operational business purposes in the preceding 12 months. We obtain the categories of personal information listed above from the following categories of sources:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: disc;">
          <li>Directly from users of Kongregate&rsquo;s services. For example, from information that the users provide to us related to the services for which they engage us.</li>
          <li>Directly and indirectly from activity on our website (www.Kongregate.com). For example, from submissions through our website portal or website usage details collected automatically.</li>
          <li>From third-parties that interact with us in connection with the services we perform. For example, from vendors who provide services to us.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Use of Personal Information.</strong>
        <p>We may disclose your Personal Information to a third party for a business purpose. “Personal information” means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular you as consumer or a household. When we disclose personal information for a business purpose, we enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.</p>
