SpeedTree Software, SpeedTree Learning Editions and SpeedTree Libraries are collectively referred to in these Wētā Tools Terms as the “SpeedTree Product(s)”. 4. Tier Eligibility for SpeedTree Products. You and everyone using certain SpeedTree Products on your behalf must be eligible for the applicable product tier at all times. This means that you meet the criteria specified below. Learning Editions: Total Finances (as that term is defined below) for the most recent twelve (12) month period may not exceed $1,000,000. If your Total Finances exceed $1,000,000 you may only use Games Enterprise or Cinema EnterpriseIndie: Total Finances for the most recent twelve (12) month period may not exceed $100,000. If your Total Finances exceed $100,000 you may only use Games Pro or Cinema ProPro: Total Finances for the most recent twelve (12) month period may not exceed $1,000,000.

No revenue cap. If you are mid-project, and your Total Finances grow to exceed the revenue cap of the tier you are using, you can simply upgrade your license and continue working. How Unity measures your Total Finances varies based on who you are. The revenue caps are shown in US currency and your Total Finances will be converted to US currency to determine your Tier Eligibility. “Total Finances” are measured for the most recent twelve (12) month period like this:If you are a Legal Entity using SpeedTree (other than to provide services to someone else), your Total Finances are your gross revenues and/or funding (no matter what the source), or, if you are a Not-for-Profit Entity, your budget for the entire entity (not just the department using SpeedTree);If you are an individual or a Legal Entity providing services to a third party, your Total Finances is deemed to be your customer or client’s Total Finances; andIf you are an individual using SpeedTree, but not providing services to a third party, your Total Finances are the amount generated in connection with your use of SpeedTree. In this case, your Total Finances would not include amounts you generate from other work (for example, if your day job is as a zookeeper). By using the SpeedTree Products, you represent and warrant that you are eligible to use the tier of SpeedTree Products you are using and those being used on your behalf. You understand that it is your responsibility to maintain complete records establishing your eligibility and you bear the burden of proving your eligibility if Unity asks. 5. No Mixing or Co-mingling; correct use of SpeedTree Software. SpeedTree Product tiers with different eligibility criteria may not be used at the same time by one entity or individual or for or on behalf of one entity or individual. For example, you must upgrade all subscriptions if your Total Finances exceed a defined revenue cap. You must also ensure that you are using the correct type of SpeedTree software for your needs. SpeedTree Cinema is not for use in any interactive or real-time productions. If you are creating an interactive or real-time production, such as a video game, training application or interactive simulation, you are required to purchase a SpeedTree Games license. Unity reserves the right to disable your use of the SpeedTree Products if you attempt to use two tiers simultaneously or use SpeedTree Cinema in a real-time production. If you are using a Games enterprise or Cinema enterprise license and want to provide services to a customer or client who is eligible in a different tier please contact Unity and we may give you an exception. Unity may monitor your compliance with and enforce these restrictions and requirements, including but not limited to monitoring any available revenue estimate data. 6.

How Unity measures your Total Finances varies based on who you are. The revenue caps are shown in US currency and your Total Finances will be converted to US currency to determine your Tier Eligibility. “Total Finances” are measured for the most recent twelve (12) month period like this:If you are a Legal Entity using SpeedTree (other than to provide services to someone else), your Total Finances are your gross revenues and/or funding (no matter what the source), or, if you are a Not-for-Profit Entity, your budget for the entire entity (not just the department using SpeedTree);If you are an individual or a Legal Entity providing services to a third party, your Total Finances is deemed to be your customer or client’s Total Finances; andIf you are an individual using SpeedTree, but not providing services to a third party, your Total Finances are the amount generated in connection with your use of SpeedTree. In this case, your Total Finances would not include amounts you generate from other work (for example, if your day job is as a zookeeper). By using the SpeedTree Products, you represent and warrant that you are eligible to use the tier of SpeedTree Products you are using and those being used on your behalf. You understand that it is your responsibility to maintain complete records establishing your eligibility and you bear the burden of proving your eligibility if Unity asks. 5. No Mixing or Co-mingling; correct use of SpeedTree Software. SpeedTree Product tiers with different eligibility criteria may not be used at the same time by one entity or individual or for or on behalf of one entity or individual. For example, you must upgrade all subscriptions if your Total Finances exceed a defined revenue cap. You must also ensure that you are using the correct type of SpeedTree software for your needs. SpeedTree Cinema is not for use in any interactive or real-time productions. If you are creating an interactive or real-time production, such as a video game, training application or interactive simulation, you are required to purchase a SpeedTree Games license. Unity reserves the right to disable your use of the SpeedTree Products if you attempt to use two tiers simultaneously or use SpeedTree Cinema in a real-time production. If you are using a Games enterprise or Cinema enterprise license and want to provide services to a customer or client who is eligible in a different tier please contact Unity and we may give you an exception. Unity may monitor your compliance with and enforce these restrictions and requirements, including but not limited to monitoring any available revenue estimate data. 6.
