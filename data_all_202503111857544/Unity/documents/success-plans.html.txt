You may not alter the designation of your Success Plan subscription without Unity's prior written consent in each instance, whether in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of your assets or to any Affiliate, as part of a corporate reorganization, or otherwise. The following limitations apply to certain Success Plan subscriptions: Starter Success Integrated Success and Publisher Support These Success Services Terms and any applicable Success Plan will remain in effect for the initial subscription period, and thereafter will automatically renew for additional, consecutive twelve (12) month periods at the then-current list price unless either party notifies the other of its intent not to renew at least ninety (90) days prior to the end of the current subscription period. Once a renewal subscription period commences, you may add to or upgrade the Success Plan you renewed, but you cannot remove, downgrade or cancel any renewed Success Plan. 2. Support Requests Unity will respond to properly submitted Support Requests concerning installation, activation, seat migration, configuration, troubleshooting and/or any other issues that may arise in connection with eligible Unity Software or your Project(s) in accordance with the response times specified in the Support Request Response Time Objectives. Responses will be provided by Unity Personnel. Unity will undertake commercially reasonable efforts, at Unity's discretion, either to provide work-arounds or to correct faults in the Unity Software. Unity will prioritize the backport of fixes to the current supported version(s) of the Unity Software for the Unity Supported Platforms that are applicable to your use of the Unity Software. In order to receive timely responses from and resolution to your Support Requests as contemplated in these Success Services Terms, you will undertake the following. In the event you do not fulfill the obligations set out below, Unity, in its sole discretion, may downgrade the priority level of the Support Request. For all properly submitted Support Requests, Unity will undertake reasonable efforts to: (a) acknowledge receipt of a Support Request from a technical Services Personnel within the Initial Response Time; (b) provide a short status report to you within a reasonable time; (c) address the Support Request by providing a remedy (e. g. , eliminating the defect in order to bring the Unity Software into substantial conformity with its applicable documentation, providing updates, or demonstrating how to avoid the effects of the defect with reasonable commercial effort). Each party acknowledges that despite a party's reasonable efforts, not all problems may be solvable. Where on-going investigation is required, you will receive regular updates to your Support Request. Additionally, such updates may increase or lower the severity of the issue, in which case the frequency of updates will change accordingly. The Success Services will be available during Business Hours, except on holidays that are recognized where Unity's employees are located (e. g. , Christmas Day, New Year's Day, Good Friday, etc. ), and on any Unity company-wide holidays. " 3. Publisher Support Support Points. Unity offers publishers the ability to purchase packages of Support Points to allocate towards Success Services for the benefit of their Designated Studios as set forth herein. Support Points purchased during any Redemption Period are redeemable only during such Redemption Period and cannot be carried over to any subsequent Redemption Period; accordingly, any Support Points that remain unused by you beyond the then-current Redemption Period will be forfeited. Subsequent Support Point packages, as well as any additional Support Points, may be ordered for subsequent Redemption Periods at Unity’s then-current pricing. Additional Support Points purchased during the Redemption Period must be purchased at least four (4) months prior to the end of the Redemption Period and will terminate at the end of the Redemption Period. If additional Support Points are purchased after the Redemption Period has commenced, the additional Support Point fee may be prorated on a per-month basis down to a minimum of four (4) months. Support Points are non-refundable. Support Point Redemption. You will work with your Partner Relations Manager to allocate purchased Support Points to the following Unity Success Plans at the corresponding redemption values: Essential Success / 1 Support Point Integrated Success (does not include separate Project Review) / 3 Support Points 1 Project Review and 1 Accelerator / included with an initial purchase of at least 5 Support Points or may be purchased for an additional fee. Support Points may be allocated to: (a) one (1) Designated Studio at a time; and (b) a particular Success Plan for a minimum of four (4) months during the Redemption Period. Provided you give Unity at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice, and provided there are at least four (4) months remaining in the Redemption Period, you may reallocate Support Points to a different Designated Studio and/or a different Success Plan. Senior-Level Contact. You agree to designate one (1) senior-level contact with whom your Partner Relations Manager will collaborate to manage your Support Point package, including allocating Support Points, arranging Project Reviews, engaging in quarterly reviews, etc. Your senior-level contact will be an authorized representative empowered to make necessary decisions for you or bring about such decisions without undue delay. Designated Studios. You are purchasing Support Points for the benefit of certain Designated Studios. Accordingly, such Designated Studios will receive the benefit of any Success Services purchased on their behalf. You acknowledge and agree that, as a condition of Unity performing any Success Services for the benefit of a Designated Studio, such Designated Studio shall be informed of and acknowledge the Success Services Terms, including any applicable Offering Identification, and you will be primarily liable for any breach of these Terms caused by a Designated Studio. 4.

Unity and its Unity Personnel will provide Success Services for up to a maximum number of concurrent Support Requests from you according to your Success Plan subscription, as described in the Support Request Response Time Objectives. Additional Support Requests can be submitted at any time, but Unity and its Unity Personnel will not be obligated to support such additional Support Requests according to the Initial Response Times and will queue such additional Support Requests and only commence services when an existing Support Request has been resolved and closed. You can adjust the order of the submitted Support Requests by setting priority levels via written notice to Unity or as otherwise agreed between you and Unity. Support Portal.

General Limitations. Unity will neither provide Success Services to end users of your Project(s), nor to sub-contractors working for you. Unity will have no obligation to provide Success Services of any kind for problems in the operation or performance of the Unity Software to the extent caused by a User-Generated Error.

If Unity, in its sole discretion, determines that remote troubleshooting and investigation techniques employed by Unity have been unsuccessful and that on-site Success Services are the most effective way to resolve a Support Request, Unity may offer to provide such limited on-site Success Services, subject to additional terms and fees. Unity may at its discretion subcontract provision of Success Services to third parties, provided that Unity will continue to remain primarily responsible under the terms of the Agreement and will ensure that such third party providers provide all agreed Success Services in accordance with the terms herein and in accordance with best industry standards.
