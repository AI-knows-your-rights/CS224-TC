F-Droid is a robot with a passion for Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) on the Android platform. On this site you’ll find a repository of FOSS apps, along with an Android client to perform installations and updates, news, reviews, and other features covering all things Android and software-freedom related.

If you want to help, you can join us. Consulting / Commercial Support If you’re running an organisation that uses F-Droid or would like to use F-Droid, you will sometimes want to have an expert. For this, we have a list of companies and developers who have contributed to F-Droid in one way or another and are available for consulting: Find an F-Droid Consultant License Terms, etc. F-Droid is a non-profit volunteer project. Although every effort is made to ensure that everything in the repository is safe to install, you use it AT YOUR OWN RISK. Wherever possible, applications in the repository are built from source, and that source code is checked for potential security or privacy issues. This checking is far from exhaustive and there are no guarantees. F-Droid respects your privacy. We don’t track you, or your device. We don’t track what you install. You don’t need an account to use the client, and it sends no additional identifying data when communicating with our web servers, other than its version number. We don’t even allow you to install other applications from the repository that track you, unless you first enable ‘Tracking’ in the AntiFeatures section of preferences. Any personal data you decide to give us (e. g. your email address when registering for an account to post on the forum) goes no further than us, and will not be used for anything other than allowing you to maintain your account. Contributors The F-Droid project was founded in 2010 by Ciaran Gultnieks, and is brought to you by at least the following people: If you have contributed to F-Droid and your name is missing, it’s a mistake and you should add yourself to the list! Please include your Weblate username if you are a translator. Keep it sorted by first name, please. The original F-Droid client app was based on the Aptoide app developed by Roberto Jacinto. العربية བོད་སྐད་ čeština Deutsch English español فارسی français עברית magyar Bahasa Indonesia íslenska italiano 日本語 한국어 polski português português do Brasil română русский shqip Türkçe українська 简体中文 繁體中文 Find Apps Donate F-Droid is powered by your donations!
