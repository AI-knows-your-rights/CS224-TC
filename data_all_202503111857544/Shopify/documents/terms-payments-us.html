The Shopify Payments Service</h2><ol>
<li><p><strong>Our Role</strong>
 The Shopify Payments service (“Shopify Payments”
 or the “Payments Services”) is a: (i) payment account boarding;
 (ii) payment underwriting; and, (iii) payment data transmission
 service that helps you integrate with a payment processor (each a
 “Processor”), as described more fully in this Agreement. The
 Payments Services may also apply to your use of point-of-sale
 equipment (“POS Equipment”), subject to availability and to your
 election to procure the same. You hereby appoint us as your agent
 to deliver information and instructions on your behalf to a
 Processor.</p><p> Under the separate <a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms">Shopify Platform Terms of
 Service</a> (the “Shopify
 Platform Terms”), Shopify Inc. provides you with its online
 storefront, shopping cart, store management, marketing, and
 other services (collectively, the “Shopify Platform Services”).
 The Shopify Platform Terms are incorporated herein by reference
 and by accepting this Agreement you are also accepting them.</p><p> Neither Shopify Inc. nor Shopify Payments (USA) Inc. is a
 bank, payment institution, or money services business, but are
 instead, respectively, a supplier of the Shopify Platform
 Services supplied under the Shopify Platform Terms and of the
 Payments Services under this Agreement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Processor</strong>
 The Processor under this Agreement is either
 (i) Stripe, Inc., organized under the laws of Delaware (“Stripe”),
 or (ii) PayPal, Inc., organized under the laws of Delaware
 (“PayPal”), each of which is a technical services provider and
 each of whom may offer the services as an agent of one or more
 financial institutions in United States (each, a “Financial
 Services Provider”). The processing and settlement of Transactions
 (as defined below) (“Payment Processing”) is carried out by a
 Processor and any of its Financial Services Providers under the
 separate terms of service listed below. Shopify, in its sole and
 absolute discretion, reserves the right to determine the Processor
 that shall perform Payment Processing services for each
 Transaction.</p><p> Where Stripe is the Processor, Payment Processing is subject to
 the <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/connect-account">Stripe Connected Account
 Agreement</a>, including
 the <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/ssa">United States Stripe Services
 Agreement</a> and the applicable
 <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/ssa">Financial Services Terms</a>, and to
 the extent you use a payment method that is subject to additional
 terms, the <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/payment-terms">Payment Terms</a>
 (collectively, the “Stripe Terms”). Where PayPal is the Processor,
 Payment Processing is subject to the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/pp-pos-ps#paypal_platform_seller_account_agreement_for_online_storefront_sellers">Platform Seller Account
 Agreement</a>
 (the “PayPal Terms”, and together with the Stripe Terms, the
 “Processor Terms”). By accepting this Agreement, you are also
 accepting and agreeing to be bound by all of the Processor Terms,
 which, in each case, is the legal agreement between you and the
 applicable Processor.</p><p> Shopify is not a party to any of the Processor Terms and is not
 liable to you in respect thereof. By accepting this Agreement and
 the Processor Terms you are agreeing to the creation of an account
 with each Processor for Payment Processing (each a “Processor
 Account”). We reserve the right to change the Processors, subject
 to the terms of our agreement with each Processor. In the event of
 any inconsistency between this Agreement and any of the Processor
 Terms, this Agreement shall prevail, except in the event of any
 inconsistency between this Agreement and the relevant Processor
 Terms concerning Payment Processing or the Processor Account, in
 which case the applicable Processor Terms shall prevail.</p><p> The Processor’s role is to accept and process credit card, debit
 card and other types of payments (collectively “Cards”) with
 respect to sales of your products and services through
 internet-based transactions (“Card Not Present Transactions&quot; or
 “CNP Transactions”). If applicable, POS Equipment permits
 transmission of data to the Processor from in-person,
 point-of-sale transactions (“Card Present Transactions&quot; or “CP
 Transactions”), as well as manually entered transactions (“Keyed
 Transactions”). CNP Transactions, CP Transactions and Keyed
 Transactions shall be referred to herein, collectively, as
 “Transactions”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shop Pay Installments</strong>
 You may enable Shop Pay Installments through your merchant portal
 or through your use of Shop Pay Installments, and by accepting this
 Agreement, you accept and agree to be bound by the <a href="https://www.shopify.com/admin/shop-pay-installments/terms">Shop Pay
 Installments Terms</a>
 and the <a href="https://www.affirm.com/terms/merchant-agreement/shop-pay">Merchant Agreement (Shop Pay Installments)</a>
 with Affirm.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Your Role</strong>
 To utilize the Services, you must be a business located in
 the United States.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Payments Services</strong>
 Shopify hereby grants you a
 non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited,
 revocable right to use the Payments Services (the “License”).
 The License shall be for the term of this Agreement only.
 Neither the License nor any other provision hereof shall grant
 any rights in the Payments Services or other intellectual
 property rights except the limited License of use set out above.</p><p> You shall not: (i) permit any third party to access the Payments
 Services, including, but not limited to, your Shopify Admin on
 our website (the “Shopify Admin”), except as permitted herein,
 and to carry out Transactions; (ii) create derivate works based
 on the Payments Services; (iii) copy, frame or mirror any part
 of the content of the Payments Services, other than copying or
 framing for your internal business purposes; (iv) reverse
 engineer, disassemble, decompile, or otherwise attempt to
 discover the source code or trade secrets for any of the
 Payments Services; or, (v) access the Payments Services in order
 to build a competitive product or service.</p><p> It is your responsibility to obtain your customers’ consent to
 be billed for each Transaction or, as the case may be, on a
 recurring basis, in compliance with applicable legal
 requirements and Visa Europe Ltd., Visa U.S.A., Inc., Visa
 Canada Inc. and Visa International (collectively, “Visa”),
 MasterCard International Incorporated (“MasterCard”), American
 Express or other applicable Card networks’ (such networks being,
 collectively, the “Payment Networks”) payment rules (the
 “Payment Network Rules”).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>POS Equipment</strong> If applicable, you may elect to purchase POS Equipment from Shopify that will allow you to accept CP Transactions and Keyed Transactions. POS hardware may be purchased on the <a href="https://www.shopify.com/pos/hardware">Shopify Hardware Store</a> (the “POS Equipment Store”). POS software may be downloaded for iOS devices from the Apple App Store under the title “Shopify POS” or “Shopify”. Your use of the Shopify POS hardware and software is subject to the applicable sections of the <a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms">Shopify Platform Terms of Service</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Payment Methods</strong>
 The Payments Services support most
 Payment Network Cards, including credit, debit, pre-paid, or
 gift cards. You assume sole and exclusive responsibility for the
 use of the Payments Services. You also assume sole and exclusive
 responsibility for Transactions under the Processor Terms. You
 are solely responsible for verifying the identity of customers
 and of the eligibility of a presented Card used to purchase your
 products and services, and Shopify does not guarantee or assume
 any liability for Transactions authorized and completed that may
 later be reversed or charged back (see section D5 below). You
 are solely responsible for all reversed or charged back
 transactions regardless of the reason for, or timing of the
 reversal or chargeback. Shopify or the Processor may add or
 remove one or more types of Payment Networks or Cards, in their
 sole discretion, at any time, without prior notice to you.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Customer Service</strong>
 Shopify will use its commercially
 reasonable efforts to provide you with customer support to help
 resolve issues relating to the Payments Services. The Processor
 retains sole and exclusive responsibility for Payment Processing
 of Transactions, including the settlement of funds, but Shopify
 will provide reasonable assistance in liaising between you and
 the relevant Processor concerning the Payment Processing services.
 You assume sole and exclusive responsibility for providing customer
 service or support to your customers for any and all issues
 related to your products and services, including, but not
 limited to, issues arising from the processing of Cards through
 the Payments Services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Taxes</strong>
 You have sole and exclusive responsibility to
 determine what, if any, taxes apply to the sale of your goods
 and services and/or the payments you receive in connection with
 your use of the Payments Services (&quot;Taxes&quot;). It is solely your
 responsibility to assess, collect, report, or remit the correct
 Taxes to the proper tax authority, whether in customers’
 jurisdictions, your jurisdiction or elsewhere. We are not
 obligated to determine whether Taxes apply, or
 calculate, collect, report, or remit any Taxes to any tax
 authority, arising from any Transaction on your behalf. 
 To the extent that Shopify is required to collects and remits 
 any taxes arising from any Transaction, Shopify may, at its 
 sole discretion, calculate and deduct, or request that a Processor 
 deduct, the corresponding amounts from any accounts associated 
 with your Shopify Payments Account, including the applicable 
 Processor Account or Reserve Account, and pay those amounts 
 to the proper tax authority. Shopify retains the right, but 
 not the obligation, at its sole discretion, to complete and 
 file tax or related reports with tax authorities regarding 
 Transactions in those jurisdictions where Shopify deems such 
 reporting necessary. You hereby indemnify and hold Shopify 
 harmless from and against any and all liability related
 to Taxes and filings made by Shopify in respect thereof.</p><p> You agree to receive all federal and state tax statements in an
 electronic format and acknowledge that paper tax statements
 will not be provided. We will notify you when an electronic
 statement is available by posting a notice in your Shopify Admin
 or emailing it to the email address listed in your Shopify Account.
 Specific instructions for access and download will be included.</p><p> In the event you withdraw consent with the Shopify Platform Terms
 and/or these terms, you will receive all electronic tax-related
 statements for the duration of time the agreement was authorized.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Your Customers</strong>
If prohibited by law, you will not impose
any fee or surcharge on a customer that seeks to use an eligible
Card. You will provide an informational slip or receipt to your
customer at the conclusion of the Transaction that includes all
information required under Payment Network Rules and applicable
law.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security</strong>
We maintain commercially reasonable
administrative, technical and physical procedures to protect all
the personal information regarding you and your customers that
is stored in our servers from unauthorized access, accidental
loss, or modification. Shopify cannot, however, guarantee that
unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those
measures or use such personal information for improper purposes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data Security</strong>
You assume full responsibility for the
security of data on your website or otherwise in your possession
or control. You agree to comply with all applicable laws and
rules in connection with your collection, security, and
dissemination of any personal, financial, Card, or Transaction
information (collectively, “Data&quot;, and as pertains to your
customers, “Cardholder Data”). You agree that at all times you
shall be compliant with applicable Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standards (“PCI-DSS”) and, as applicable, the Payment
Application Data Security Standards (“PA-DSS”). You agree to
promptly provide Shopify with documentation evidencing your
compliance with PCI-DSS and/or PA-DSS upon request. You also
agree that you will use only PCI-DSS and PA-DSS compliant
service providers in connection with the storage or transmission
of Card information, including a cardholder’s account number,
expiration date, and CVV2. You must not store CVV2 data at any
time. Information on PCI-DSS can be found on the <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/">PCI Council’s
website</a>. It is your
responsibility to comply with these standards and all the
Payment Network Rules. We may request additional security measures
at any time and reserve the right to adjust these requirements at
our discretion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Audit Right</strong>
If Shopify believes that a security breach,
personal data breach, or other compromise of data may have
occurred, Shopify may require you to have a third-party auditor
that is approved by Shopify conduct a security audit of your
systems and facilities and issue a report to be provided to
Shopify and, at Shopify’s discretion, to the Processor, its
Financial Services Provider(s), Payment Networks, and law
enforcement, at your sole cost and expense.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Privacy</strong>
Your privacy and the protection of your data
are very important to us. You acknowledge that you have
received, read in full, and agree with the terms of our <a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy">Privacy
Policy</a>, our <a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/dpa">Data
Processing Addendum</a>, and each
Processor’s Privacy Policy (for Stripe see
<a href="https://stripe.com/privacy">here</a> and for PayPal see
<a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/privacy-full?locale.x=en_US">here</a>).
Our Privacy Policy and Data Processing Addendum are hereby
incorporated into this Agreement. Shopify’s Privacy Policy and
each Processor’s Privacy Policy contain important information
about the collection, use, retention, and disclosure of personal
information, as well as other important matters, and explains
how and for what purposes we and the Processor collect, use,
retain, disclose and safeguard the information you provide to
us. You agree that Shopify’s Privacy Policy and each Processor’s
Privacy Policy may be modified at Shopify’s or the Processor’s
option, if necessary, and you will check each Privacy Policy on
a regular basis. You also acknowledge that the Processors are
required to report your business name and the name of your
principals to the Member Alert to Control High-Risk merchants
list of MasterCard (“MATCH List”) maintained by MasterCard and
accessed and updated by American Express, to the VMAS database
upheld by Visa Europe, and/or to the Consortium Merchant
Negative File maintained by Discover, if applicable, pursuant to
the requirements of the Payment Network Rules. Additionally, you
agree that Shopify’s collection, use, retention, and disclosure
of personal information is subject to our Data Processing
Addendum.</p><p>We will at all times comply with the provisions of applicable
data protection law, including the EU General Data Protection
Regulation (“GDPR”), as applicable. If we process any of your
personal data when performing our obligations under this
Agreement, we will do so as a “data controller”, as defined by the
GDPR. If we process any Cardholder Data on your behalf, we and you
both agree that it is our intention that you shall be the “data
controller” and we shall be the “data processor” in relation to
that data, as those terms are defined in the GDPR. We shall
process the personal data only in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and any lawful instructions reasonably given by you
to us from time to time. Additionally, you acknowledge that each
Processor acts as a “data controller”, or as otherwise agreed
between you and the Processor, with regards to any personal data
that they may process under this Agreement and that we are not
responsible for how they process such data.</p><p>We will notify you (within a reasonable time frame) if we
receive a request from a person to have access to, or to erase
that person’s personal data, a complaint or request relating to
your obligations under applicable data protection legislation,
or any other communication relating directly to the processing
of any personal data in connection with this Agreement. You
acknowledge that such requests may be subject to independent
legal retention or confidentiality requirements, as permitted by
the GDPR.</p><p>We will provide you with reasonable co-operation and assistance
in relation to any complaint or request made in respect of any
personal data processed by us on your behalf, including by
providing you with details of the complaint or request, helping
you to comply with any data subject access requests (within the
relevant timescales set out in applicable data protection
legislation), and providing you with any personal data we hold
in relation to a person making a complaint or request (again,
within a reasonable timescale).</p><p>You acknowledge that we are relying on you for direction as to
the extent to which we are entitled to use and process the
personal data in the Cardholder Data that you provide us with.
Consequently, we will not be liable for any claim brought by a
data subject arising from any action or omission by us, to the
extent that such action or omission resulted from your
instruction.</p><p>You consent to the exchange of your information between the
account(s) you have established through the Shopify Platform
Services and the Payments Services established under this
Agreement. Shopify will commingle such accounts and refer to them
together in this Agreement as the “Shopify Payments Account”.</p><p>Additionally, when you elect to use a third party sales
channel integration made available through the Shopify
Platform Services (e.g. choosing to sell your products on
Facebook) your transactions on such third party sales channel
(“Third Party Channel”) may be processed by Shopify Payments.
Where Shopify Payments process transactions on your behalf on
a Third Party Channel, you agree and consent to Shopify
sharing or disclosing your data (including personal
information) with the operator of the Third Party Channel in
the context of a data breach or audit, if Shopify is required
to do in connection with its performance of the Payments
Services.</p><p>Where a data subject is located in the U.K. or the European
Economic Area that data subject&#39;s personal data will be processed
by Shopify International Limited, in accordance with our Privacy
Policy. As part of providing the Payments Services, this personal
data may be transferred to other regions, including to Canada and
the United States. Additionally, in order to process, use, record,
and disclose your personal information, information related to
your business, and Data, we or our agents may transfer such
information to and receive it from the Processor, its Financial
Services Provider(s), or their respective agents and, in so doing,
we may transmit or possess it outside of your jurisdiction.</p><p>Additionally, in order to provide the Payments Services, we use
a variety of third party “sub-processors” that fall into many
broad categories—for example, we use sub-processors to help us:
(i) protect you and Shopify from potentially risky transactions,
security threats, or fraud; (ii) perform administrative tasks;
(iii) deliver portions of the Payments Services (e.g., third
parties that work with us to actually process credit card
payments or conduct any shipping); (iv) develop and improve our
products and the Payments Services; (v) generate analytics or
other information relating to the Payments Services; and, (vi)
build our technical infrastructure (e.g., using cloud storage
providers or information security vendors). By using the
Payments Services, you consent to our use of sub-processors,
which is described in more detail in our <a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy">Privacy
Policy</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Privacy of Others</strong>

maintain a publicly accessible privacy policy that accurately
discloses how you collect, use, and disclose personal data,
including through the Payments Services. Additionally, you
represent to us that you have obtained all necessary rights and
consents under applicable law to allow us and the Processor to
collect, use, retain, and disclose any Cardholder Data that you
provide to, or authorize us to collect, including information
that we may collect directly from you of your customers via
cookies or other means and to use that data to provide the
Payments Services (e.g., to process Transactions and to screen
for fraud or compliance purposes).</p><p>Further, you represent that we will not be in breach of any such
laws by collecting, receiving, using, and disclosing such
information in connection with the Payments Services as
described in our <a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy">Privacy
Policy</a>. As between the
parties to this Agreement, you are solely responsible for
disclosing to your customers that we will collect and process
their Cardholder Data in our supply of the Payments Services to
you, and that in so doing we may transmit or possess it outside
of your or their jurisdiction, and that it may be subject to
disclosure as required by applicable law.</p><p>If you receive information about others, including cardholders
and other customers, through the use of the Payments Services,
you must keep such information confidential and only use it in
connection with the Payments Services or as otherwise permitted
by the subject of such information.</p><p>You may not disclose or distribute any such information to a
third party or use any such information for marketing purposes
unless you receive the express consent of the subject thereof to
do so. You may not disclose Cardholder Data to any third party
other than in connection with processing a Transaction requested
by your customer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Restricted Use</strong>

limitations of the Payments Services or Shopify’s checkout, use
any tool to enable features or functionalities that are otherwise
disabled in the Payments Services, or decompile, disassemble, or
otherwise reverse engineer the Payments Services, except to the

following: (i) access or attempt to access our systems,
programs, or data that are not made available for public use;
(ii) copy, reproduce, republish, upload, post, transmit, resell,

except as expressly allowed under this section.</p></li>

We reserve the right to not provide the Payments Services in 
respect of any Transaction you submit that we believe, in our 
sole discretion, is in violation of this Agreement, any other 
Shopify or Processor agreement, or exposes you, Shopify, the
Processors, or any other third party to actual or potential risk
or harm, including, but not limited to, fraud and other criminal
acts. You are hereby granting us authorization to share information
with law enforcement about you, your Transactions, or
your Shopify Payments Account.</p></li>

<h2 id="c-processing-card-transactions-and-receiving-your-funds" class="text-t4">C. Processing Card Transactions and Receiving Your Funds</h2><ol>
<li><p><strong>Shopify Payments Fees</strong>
 You agree to pay the fees for
 processing that are set out in your Shopify Admin, which are
 incorporated herein by reference (the &quot;Processing Fees&quot;).
 Processing Fees shall be collected from you by the applicable
 Processor on our behalf in accordance with the Processor Terms.</p><p> If applicable, fees for POS Equipment are posted here:
 <a href="https://www.shopify.com/pos/hardware">www.shopify.com/pos/hardware</a>
 and here:
 <a href="https://www.shopify.com/pricing">www.shopify.com/pricing</a> (the
 “POS Equipment Fees”). At our discretion, POS Equipment Fees
 will be collected on our behalf by the applicable Processor 
 pursuant to the Processor Terms or by such other means as we 
 may prescribe from time to time.</p><p> Fees for Shopify Platform Services are collected by Shopify
 pursuant to the <a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms">Shopify Platform Terms of
 Service</a> (the &quot;Shopify
 Platform Services Fees&quot;). Processing Fees, Equipment Fees, and
 Shopify Platform Services Fees shall be referred to herein
 collectively as the &quot;Fees&quot;.</p><p> You are obligated to pay all applicable taxes, fees and other
 charges imposed by any governmental authority, including,
 without limitation, any value added tax, goods and services tax,
 harmonized sales tax and/or provincial or territorial sales tax,
 on the Payments Services provided under this Agreement. If you
 are tax-exempt, you will provide us with an appropriate
 certificate or other evidence of tax exemption that is
 satisfactory to us.</p><p> We reserve the right to change the Fees at any time, subject to
 a thirty (30) day notice period to you in accordance with
 Section A19. If you continue to use the Payments Services and
 the Processor Services for such thirty (30) days, then you are
 deemed to have accepted the change in Fees contemplated by such
 notice. Notwithstanding the thirty (30) day notice period referred
 to above, if Shopify or the Processor suspends, disables, or
 otherwise makes your Shopify Payments Account unavailable to
 you, or if you choose to no longer use Shopify Payments, upon
 your account being reinstated by Shopify or the Processor,
 or if you choose to enable Shopify Payments again, the then
 current Fees shall apply to you.</p><p> In addition to the Fees, you are also responsible for any
 penalties and fines imposed on you or on us by any bank, money
 services business, payment network, financial institution, or
 other financial intermediary resulting from your use of the
 Payments Services in a manner not permitted by this Agreement or
 by such financial intermediary’s rules and regulations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Security Interest</strong>
 As security for performance of your
 obligations under this Agreement, you grant us a first priority
 lien and security interest on all funds processed and deposited
 into all bank accounts or other financial accounts designated in
 your Shopify Admin to receive funds from the settlement of 
 Transactions (the &quot;Payout Account&quot;), and any other bank accounts associated with your Shopify
 Payments Account, and in any funds processed using the Payment
 Processing services. These security interests and liens will
 secure payment and performance of all of your obligations under
 this Agreement and any other agreements now existing or later
 entered into between us and you, including, without limitation,
 your obligation to pay any amounts due and owing to us. You will
 execute, deliver and pay the fees for any documents we request,
 and authorize Shopify to take any other action necessary including
 registering notice of such security interest in a public registry,
 to create, perfect, maintain, and enforce this security interest.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Our Collection Rights</strong>
 To the extent permitted by law, we
 may collect any obligations you owe us under this Agreement by
 requesting that a Processor deduct the corresponding amounts
 from a Reserve Account (as that term is defined below) or from
 funds payable to you arising from the settlement of
 Transactions. Fees will be assessed at the time a Transaction is
 processed and will be first deducted from the funds received for
 such Transaction. If these amounts are not sufficient to meet
 your obligations to us, we may charge the payment method
 associated with your Shopify Payments Account for any amounts
 owed to us. Your failure to fully pay amounts that you owe us on
 demand will be a breach of this Agreement. You will be liable
 for our costs associated with collection in addition to the
 amount owed, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and
 expenses, costs of any arbitration or court proceeding,
 collection agency fees, and any applicable interest.</p><p> Further, we may deduct, or request that a Processor deduct, from
 any accounts associated with your Shopify Payments Account,
 including the applicable Processor Account or Reserve Account, any
 amounts that you owe to us under this Agreement or any other
 agreement you have entered into with us or our affiliates. In
 accordance with the above and the Processor Terms you authorize us
 to debit your Payout Account, without separate notice, to collect
 amounts you owe under this Agreement, pursuant to the <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/bank-debit-authorizations">User Bank
 Account Debit
 Authorization</a>
 and the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/content/terms/shopify-debit-authorization-ach?locale.x=en_US">Platform Seller Debit
 Authorization</a>
 (each of which shall form part of the “Processor Terms”).</p><p> Additionally, we may require a personal guarantee from a
 principal of a business for funds owed under this Agreement. If
 we require a personal guarantee we will specifically inform you
 in advance.</p><p> In addition to the amount due, delinquent accounts may be
 charged with fees that are incidental to the collection of
 delinquent accounts and chargebacks, including, but not limited
 to, collection fees and convenience fees and other third-party
 charges.</p><p> You hereby explicitly agree that all communication in relation
 to delinquent accounts will be made by electronic mail or by
 phone, as provided to Shopify by you. Such communication may be
 made by Shopify or by anyone on its behalf, including, but not
 limited to, a third-party collection agent.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reserves</strong>
 Funds held in reserves are amounts of money set
 aside to cover chargebacks, refunds, or other payment
 obligations under this Agreement (the &quot;Reserve Account&quot;). We, in
 our discretion, will set the terms of any Reserve Account and
 notify you of such terms, which may require that a certain
 amount (including the full amount) of the funds received for a
 Transaction are held for a period of time, or that additional
 amounts are held in the Reserve Account. We, in our discretion,
 may elect to change the terms of a Reserve Account at any
 time, for any reason, based on your payment processing history
 or as requested by our payment processors.</p><p> We may require you to fund the Reserve Account by means of: (i)
 any funds payouts made or due to you for Transactions submitted to
 the Payments Services; or, (ii) amounts available in your Payout
 Account by means of ACH debit;
 or, (iii) other sources of funds associated with your Shopify
 Payments Account; or, (iv) requesting that you provide funds to us
 for deposit to the Reserve Account.</p><p> You agree that: (i) you are not entitled to any interest or
 other compensation associated with the funds held in the Reserve
 Account; (ii) you have no right to direct that account; (iii)
 you have no legal interest in those funds or that account; and,
 (iv) you may not assign any interest in those funds or that
 account.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contesting Chargebacks</strong>
 You or Shopify may elect to
 contest chargebacks assessed to your account. Shopify may
 provide you with assistance, including notifications and
 software to help contest your chargebacks. We do not assume any
 liability for our role or assistance in contesting chargebacks.</p><p> You grant us permission to share records or other information
 required with the cardholder, the cardholder’s financial
 institution, and your financial institution to help resolve any
 chargeback. You acknowledge that your failure to provide us with
 complete and accurate information in a timely manner may result
 in an irreversible chargeback being assessed.</p><p> If the cardholder’s issuing bank or the Payment Network does not
 resolve a dispute in your favor, we may recover the chargeback
 amount and any associated fees from you as described in this
 Agreement.</p><p> We reserve the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for
 mediating or investigating chargeback disputes.</p></li>

<h2 id="d-termination-and-other-general-legal-terms" class="text-t4">D. Termination and Other General Legal Terms</h2><ol>
<li><p><strong>Term</strong>
 The Agreement is effective upon the date you agree
 to it (by electronically indicating acceptance) and continues so
 long as you use the Payments Services or until terminated by you
 or by Shopify.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Termination</strong>
 You may terminate this Agreement by closing
 your Shopify Payments Account at any time by following the
 instructions in your Shopify Admin. We may terminate this
 Agreement and close your Shopify Payments Account at any time,
 for any reason, upon notice to you in accordance with Section
 A19 above. We may suspend your Shopify Payments Account and your
 access to the Payments Services and any rights in respect of
 your Shopify Payments Account, or terminate this Agreement, at
 any time, for any reason, including if: (i) we determine that
 you may be ineligible for the Payments Services because of the
 risk associated with your Shopify Payments Account, including,
 without limitation, significant credit or fraud risk, or for any
 other reason; (ii) you do not comply with any of the provisions
 of this Agreement or the Processor Terms; or, (iii) upon request
 of the Payment Network, a Processor, or a Card issuer.
 Termination of the Processor Terms may, at the discretion of
 Shopify, result in a termination of this Agreement. Termination
 of this Agreement shall entitle Shopify to cause each Processor
 to terminate its Processor Terms.</p><p> If a Processor terminates its Processor Terms or indicates its
 intention to do so, or if you elect to cease processing with such
 Processor, we have the right, but not the obligation, to offer you
 a substitute payment processor that is integrated with the Shopify
 Payments Account. Upon your acceptance of the terms of service of
 such substitute payment processor, they shall be deemed to have
 replaced the previous Processor contemplated herein, provided that
 your liabilities to such Processor herein shall not be diminished
 on account of accepting the terms of the substitute payment
 processor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Effects of Termination</strong>
 Upon termination and closing of your Shopify Payments Account, 
 we will immediately discontinue your access to the Payments 
 Services. You agree to complete all pending Transactions, 
 immediately remove all logos for Cards, and stop accepting new 
 Transactions through the Payments Services. You will not be 
 refunded the remainder of any Fees that you have paid for
 the Payments Services if your access to or use of the Payments
 Services is terminated or suspended. Any funds in the Financial
 Services Provider’s custody will be paid out to you subject to 
 the Processor Terms.</p><p> Termination does not relieve you of your obligations as defined
 in this Agreement, and a Processor may elect to continue to
 hold any funds deemed necessary, pending resolution of any other
 terms or obligations defined in this Agreement, including, but
 not limited to, chargebacks, fees, refunds, or other
 investigations or proceedings.</p><p> Termination of this Agreement will not necessarily terminate
 your Shopify Platform Terms, unless Shopify determines
 otherwise.</p><p> Upon termination you agree: (i) to immediately cease your use of
 the Payments Services; (ii) to discontinue use of any Shopify or
 Processor trademarks and to immediately remove any Shopify or
 Processor references and logos from your website and/or physical
 location, if applicable; (iii) that the license granted under
 this Agreement shall end; (iv) that we reserve the right (but
 have no obligation) to delete all of your information and
 account data stored on our servers; (v) that we will not be
 liable to you for compensation, reimbursement, or damages in
 connection with your use of the Payments Services, or any
 termination or suspension of the Payments Services, or deletion
 of your information or account data; and, (vi) that you will
 still be liable to us for any fees or fines, or other financial
 obligation incurred by you or through your use of the Payments
 Services prior to termination.</p></li>

 your liability under the Processor Terms or Shopify Platform
 Terms. You are obliged to fulfill your obligations under this
 Agreement and those under the Processor Terms and Shopify
 Platform Terms.</p><p> Shopify has agreed to indemnify and hold the Processors harmless

 or other relationships between you and your customers; or, (v)
 third-party indemnity obligations we incur as a direct or
 indirect result of your acts or omissions, including, but not
 limited to, indemnification of any Processor or any Payment
 Network.</p><p> We will have the final decision-making authority with respect to
 Claims, including, without limitation, claims for refunds for
 purchased items that are filed with us by you or your customers.

<li><p><strong>Disputes, Choice of Law, Jurisdiction, Venue and Miscellaneous</strong>
 You agree that any disputes arising out of or
 relating to this Agreement or the Payments Services shall be
 resolved in accordance with this Section D9.</p><p> This Agreement is governed by the laws of Delaware except for any
 security interest created pursuant to Section C2 above, which
 will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
 the applicable country, state, province, territory, or other
 jurisdiction in which such security interest is registered, and
 in each case without regard to its choice of law provisions to
 the contrary. The exclusive venue for any actions or claims
 arising under or related to this Agreement shall be a court of
 competent jurisdiction in Delaware.</p><p> Shopify may, or may direct the applicable Processor to respond to
 and comply with any subpoena, warrant, or other legal order
 (“Legal Process”) that we believe to be valid. Such Processor or
 any applicable Financial Services Provider may deliver or hold any
 funds or any Data as required under such Legal Process, even if
 you are receiving funds or Data on behalf of other parties.
 Where permitted by law, we will make reasonable efforts to
 provide you notice of such Legal Process by sending a copy to
 the email address we have on file for you. We are not
 responsible for any losses, whether direct or indirect, that you
 may incur as a result of our response or compliance with a Legal
 Process.</p><p> Headings are included for convenience only and shall not be
 considered in interpreting this Agreement. The Agreement does
 not limit any rights that we may have under trade secret,
 copyright, patent, or other laws. Our failure to assert any
 right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a
 waiver of such right or provision. No waiver of any term of this
 Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such
 term or any other term.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Right to Amend</strong>
We have the right to change or add to
the terms of this Agreement at any time, and to change, delete,
discontinue, or impose conditions on any feature or aspect of
the Payments Services or software with notice that we in our
sole discretion deem to be reasonable in the circumstances,
including such notice in your Shopify Admin, or any other
website maintained or owned by us for the purposes of providing
services in terms of this Agreement. Any use of the Payments
Services after our publication of any such changes shall
constitute your acceptance of this Agreement as modified.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assignment</strong>
This Agreement, and any rights and licenses
granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you
without our prior written consent, but may be assigned by us
without consent or other restriction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Change of Business</strong>
You agree to give us at least thirty
(30) days prior notification of your intent to change your
current product or services types, your business or trade name,
or the manner in which you accept payment. You agree to provide
us with prompt notification within three (3) days if you are the
subject of any voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency
application, petition or proceeding, receivership, bankruptcy,
or similar action or proceeding initiated by or against you or
any of your principals (any of the foregoing, a “Bankruptcy
Proceeding”). You also agree to promptly notify us within three
(3) days of any adverse change in your financial condition, any
planned or anticipated liquidation or substantial change in the
basic nature of your business, any transfer or sale of
twenty-five percent (25%) or more of your total assets, or any
change in the control or ownership of your or your parent
entity. You will also notify us within three (3) days of any
judgment, writ, warrant of attachment or execution, or levy
against twenty-five percent (25%) or more of your total assets.</p><p>You will include us on the list and matrix of creditors as filed
with any bankruptcy, commercial or civil court in connection
with any Bankruptcy Proceeding, whether or not a claim may exist
at the time of filing. Failure to do so will be cause for
immediate termination of this Agreement and shall allow the
pursuit of any other action available to us under the applicable
Payment Network Rules or law.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Parties</strong>
This Agreement binds you and your respective
heirs, representatives, and permitted and approved successors
(including those by merger and acquisition), or any permitted
assigns.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Third-Party Services and Links to Other Web Sites</strong>
You may be offered services, products, and promotions provided by
third parties and not by us. If you decide to use these
third-party services, you will be responsible for reviewing and
understanding the terms and conditions associated with these
services. You agree that we are not responsible for the
performance of these services. The Shopify website may contain
links to third-party websites as a convenience to you. The
inclusion of any website link does not imply an approval,
endorsement, or recommendation by us. You agree that your access
to any such website is at your own risk, and that the site is
not governed by the terms and conditions contained in this
Agreement. We expressly disclaim any liability for these
websites. Please remember that when you use a link to go from
our website to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer
in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website,
including those that have a link on our website, is subject to
that website’s own rules and policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Force Majeure</strong>
No party will be liable for delays in
processing or other non-performance caused by such events as
fires, telecommunications failures, utility failures, power
failures, equipment failures, labor strife, riots, war,
terrorist attack, non-performance of our vendors or suppliers,
acts of God, or other causes over which the respective party has
no reasonable control, except that nothing in this section will
affect or excuse your liabilities and obligations under Sections
C1 or D5, including, without limitation, for reversals,
chargebacks, claims, fines, fees, refunds or unfulfilled
products and services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Entire Agreement and Remedies</strong>
These terms and
conditions, and all policies and procedures that are
incorporated herein by reference, constitute the entire
agreement between you and Shopify with respect to the provision
of the Payments Services. Except as otherwise set out herein, in
the event of a conflict between this Agreement and any other
Shopify or Processor agreement or policy, this Agreement shall
prevail on the subject matter of this Agreement. Except as
expressly provided in this Agreement, these terms describe the
entire liability of Shopify and our vendors and suppliers and
sets forth your exclusive remedies with respect to the Payments
Services and your access and use of the Payments Services. If
any provision of this Agreement (or portion thereof) is held to
be invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then it shall
be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such
provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law,
and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and
effect.</p><p>This Agreement has been reviewed by you with the benefit of
independent legal counsel to the extent you consider necessary,
and any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are
to be resolved against the drafting party shall not apply to the
construction or interpretation of this Agreement. The rights
conferred upon us in this Agreement are not intended to be
exclusive of each other or of any other rights and remedies we
may have at law or in equity. Rather, each and every right we
may have under this Agreement, at law or in equity, is
cumulative and concurrent, and in addition to every other right.</p><p>This Agreement may be available in languages other than English.
To the extent of any inconsistencies or conflicts between this
English Agreement and the Agreements available in another
language, the most current English version of the Agreement will
prevail.</p></li>

The Shopify Payments Service\\n\\n1. **Our Role**\\n    The Shopify Payments service (“Shopify Payments”\\n    or the “Payments Services”) is a: (i) payment account boarding;\\n    (ii) payment underwriting; and, (iii) payment data transmission\\n    service that helps you integrate with a payment processor (each a\\n    “Processor”), as described more fully in this Agreement. The\\n    Payments Services may also apply to your use of point-of-sale\\n    equipment (“POS Equipment”), subject to availability and to your\\n    election to procure the same. You hereby appoint us as your agent\\n    to deliver information and instructions on your behalf to a\\n    Processor.\\n\\n    Under the separate [Shopify Platform Terms of\\n    Service](https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms) (the “Shopify\\n    Platform Terms”), Shopify Inc. provides you with its online\\n    storefront, shopping cart, store management, marketing, and\\n    other services (collectively, the “Shopify Platform Services”).\\n    The Shopify Platform Terms are incorporated herein by reference\\n    and by accepting this Agreement you are also accepting them.\\n\\n    Neither Shopify Inc. nor Shopify Payments (USA) Inc. is a\\n    bank, payment institution, or money services business, but are\\n    instead, respectively, a supplier of the Shopify Platform\\n    Services supplied under the Shopify Platform Terms and of the\\n    Payments Services under this Agreement.\\n\\n2. **The Processor**\\n    The Processor under this Agreement is either\\n    (i) Stripe, Inc., organized under the laws of Delaware (“Stripe”),\\n    or (ii) PayPal, Inc., organized under the laws of Delaware\\n    (“PayPal”), each of which is a technical services provider and\\n    each of whom may offer the services as an agent of one or more\\n    financial institutions in United States (each, a “Financial\\n    Services Provider”). The processing and settlement of Transactions\\n    (as defined below) (“Payment Processing”) is carried out by a\\n    Processor and any of its Financial Services Providers under the\\n    separate terms of service listed below. Shopify, in its sole and\\n    absolute discretion, reserves the right to determine the Processor\\n    that shall perform Payment Processing services for each\\n    Transaction.\\n\\n    Where Stripe is the Processor, Payment Processing is subject to\\n    the [Stripe Connected Account\\n    Agreement](https://stripe.com/legal/connect-account), including\\n    the [United States Stripe Services\\n    Agreement](https://stripe.com/legal/ssa) and the applicable\\n    [Financial Services Terms](https://stripe.com/legal/ssa), and to\\n    the extent you use a payment method that is subject to additional\\n    terms, the [Payment Terms](https://stripe.com/legal/payment-terms)\\n    (collectively, the “Stripe Terms”). Where PayPal is the Processor,\\n    Payment Processing is subject to the [Platform Seller Account\\n    Agreement](https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/pp-pos-ps#paypal_platform_seller_account_agreement_for_online_storefront_sellers)\\n    (the “PayPal Terms”, and together with the Stripe Terms, the\\n    “Processor Terms”). By accepting this Agreement, you are also\\n    accepting and agreeing to be bound by all of the Processor Terms,\\n    which, in each case, is the legal agreement between you and the\\n    applicable Processor.\\n\\n    Shopify is not a party to any of the Processor Terms and is not\\n    liable to you in respect thereof. By accepting this Agreement and\\n    the Processor Terms you are agreeing to the creation of an account\\n    with each Processor for Payment Processing (each a “Processor\\n    Account”). We reserve the right to change the Processors, subject\\n    to the terms of our agreement with each Processor. In the event of\\n    any inconsistency between this Agreement and any of the Processor\\n    Terms, this Agreement shall prevail, except in the event of any\\n    inconsistency between this Agreement and the relevant Processor\\n    Terms concerning Payment Processing or the Processor Account, in\\n    which case the applicable Processor Terms shall prevail.\\n\\n    The Processor’s role is to accept and process credit card, debit\\n    card and other types of payments (collectively “Cards”) with\\n    respect to sales of your products and services through\\n    internet-based transactions (“Card Not Present Transactions\\\" or\\n    “CNP Transactions”). If applicable, POS Equipment permits\\n    transmission of data to the Processor from in-person,\\n    point-of-sale transactions (“Card Present Transactions\\\" or “CP\\n    Transactions”), as well as manually entered transactions (“Keyed\\n    Transactions”). CNP Transactions, CP Transactions and Keyed\\n    Transactions shall be referred to herein, collectively, as\\n    “Transactions”.\\n\\n3. **Shop Pay Installments**\\n    You may enable Shop Pay Installments through your merchant portal\\n    or through your use of Shop Pay Installments, and by accepting this\\n    Agreement, you accept and agree to be bound by the [Shop Pay\\n    Installments Terms](https://www.shopify.com/admin/shop-pay-installments/terms)\\n    and the [Merchant Agreement (Shop Pay Installments)](https://www.affirm.com/terms/merchant-agreement/shop-pay)\\n    with Affirm.\\n\\n4. **Your Role**\\n    To utilize the Services, you must be a business located in\\n    the United States.\\n\\n5. **The Payments Services**\\n    Shopify hereby grants you a\\n    non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited,\\n    revocable right to use the Payments Services (the “License”).\\n    The License shall be for the term of this Agreement only.\\n    Neither the License nor any other provision hereof shall grant\\n    any rights in the Payments Services or other intellectual\\n    property rights except the limited License of use set out above.\\n\\n    You shall not: (i) permit any third party to access the Payments\\n    Services, including, but not limited to, your Shopify Admin on\\n    our website (the “Shopify Admin”), except as permitted herein,\\n    and to carry out Transactions; (ii) create derivate works based\\n    on the Payments Services; (iii) copy, frame or mirror any part\\n    of the content of the Payments Services, other than copying or\\n    framing for your internal business purposes; (iv) reverse\\n    engineer, disassemble, decompile, or otherwise attempt to\\n    discover the source code or trade secrets for any of the\\n    Payments Services; or, (v) access the Payments Services in order\\n    to build a competitive product or service.\\n\\n    It is your responsibility to obtain your customers’ consent to\\n    be billed for each Transaction or, as the case may be, on a\\n    recurring basis, in compliance with applicable legal\\n    requirements and Visa Europe Ltd., Visa U.S.A., Inc., Visa\\n    Canada Inc. and Visa International (collectively, “Visa”),\\n    MasterCard International Incorporated (“MasterCard”), American\\n    Express or other applicable Card networks’ (such networks being,\\n    collectively, the “Payment Networks”) payment rules (the\\n    “Payment Network Rules”).\\n\\n6. **POS Equipment** If applicable, you may elect to purchase POS Equipment from Shopify that will allow you to accept CP Transactions and Keyed Transactions. POS hardware may be purchased on the [Shopify Hardware Store](https://www.shopify.com/pos/hardware) (the “POS Equipment Store”). POS software may be downloaded for iOS devices from the Apple App Store under the title “Shopify POS” or “Shopify”. Your use of the Shopify POS hardware and software is subject to the applicable sections of the [Shopify Platform Terms of Service](https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms).\\n\\n7. **Payment Methods**\\n    The Payments Services support most\\n    Payment Network Cards, including credit, debit, pre-paid, or\\n    gift cards. You assume sole and exclusive responsibility for the\\n    use of the Payments Services. You also assume sole and exclusive\\n    responsibility for Transactions under the Processor Terms. You\\n    are solely responsible for verifying the identity of customers\\n    and of the eligibility of a presented Card used to purchase your\\n    products and services, and Shopify does not guarantee or assume\\n    any liability for Transactions authorized and completed that may\\n    later be reversed or charged back (see section D5 below). You\\n    are solely responsible for all reversed or charged back\\n    transactions regardless of the reason for, or timing of the\\n    reversal or chargeback. Shopify or the Processor may add or\\n    remove one or more types of Payment Networks or Cards, in their\\n    sole discretion, at any time, without prior notice to you.\\n\\n8. **Customer Service**\\n    Shopify will use its commercially\\n    reasonable efforts to provide you with customer support to help\\n    resolve issues relating to the Payments Services. The Processor\\n    retains sole and exclusive responsibility for Payment Processing\\n    of Transactions, including the settlement of funds, but Shopify\\n    will provide reasonable assistance in liaising between you and\\n    the relevant Processor concerning the Payment Processing services.\\n    You assume sole and exclusive responsibility for providing customer\\n    service or support to your customers for any and all issues\\n    related to your products and services, including, but not\\n    limited to, issues arising from the processing of Cards through\\n    the Payments Services.\\n\\n9. **Taxes**\\n    You have sole and exclusive responsibility to\\n    determine what, if any, taxes apply to the sale of your goods\\n    and services and/or the payments you receive in connection with\\n    your use of the Payments Services (\\\"Taxes\\\"). It is solely your\\n    responsibility to assess, collect, report, or remit the correct\\n    Taxes to the proper tax authority, whether in customers’\\n    jurisdictions, your jurisdiction or elsewhere. We are not\\n    obligated to determine whether Taxes apply, or\\n    calculate, collect, report, or remit any Taxes to any tax\\n    authority, arising from any Transaction on your behalf. \\n    To the extent that Shopify is required to collects and remits \\n    any taxes arising from any Transaction, Shopify may, at its \\n    sole discretion, calculate and deduct, or request that a Processor \\n    deduct, the corresponding amounts from any accounts associated \\n    with your Shopify Payments Account, including the applicable \\n    Processor Account or Reserve Account, and pay those amounts \\n    to the proper tax authority. Shopify retains the right, but \\n    not the obligation, at its sole discretion, to complete and \\n    file tax or related reports with tax authorities regarding \\n    Transactions in those jurisdictions where Shopify deems such \\n    reporting necessary. You hereby indemnify and hold Shopify \\n    harmless from and against any and all liability related\\n    to Taxes and filings made by Shopify in respect thereof.\\n\\n    You agree to receive all federal and state tax statements in an\\n    electronic format and acknowledge that paper tax statements\\n    will not be provided. We will notify you when an electronic\\n    statement is available by posting a notice in your Shopify Admin\\n    or emailing it to the email address listed in your Shopify Account.\\n    Specific instructions for access and download will be included.\\n\\n    In the event you withdraw consent with the Shopify Platform Terms\\n    and/or these terms, you will receive all electronic tax-related\\n    statements for the duration of time the agreement was authorized.\\n\\n10. **Your Customers**\\n    If prohibited by law, you will not impose\\n    any fee or surcharge on a customer that seeks to use an eligible\\n    Card. You will provide an informational slip or receipt to your\\n    customer at the conclusion of the Transaction that includes all\\n    information required under Payment Network Rules and applicable\\n    law.\\n\\n11. **Security**\\n    We maintain commercially reasonable\\n    administrative, technical and physical procedures to protect all\\n    the personal information regarding you and your customers that\\n    is stored in our servers from unauthorized access, accidental\\n    loss, or modification. Shopify cannot, however, guarantee that\\n    unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those\\n    measures or use such personal information for improper purposes.\\n\\n12. **Data Security**\\n    You assume full responsibility for the\\n    security of data on your website or otherwise in your possession\\n    or control. You agree to comply with all applicable laws and\\n    rules in connection with your collection, security, and\\n    dissemination of any personal, financial, Card, or Transaction\\n    information (collectively, “Data\\\", and as pertains to your\\n    customers, “Cardholder Data”). You agree that at all times you\\n    shall be compliant with applicable Payment Card Industry Data\\n    Security Standards (“PCI-DSS”) and, as applicable, the Payment\\n    Application Data Security Standards (“PA-DSS”). You agree to\\n    promptly provide Shopify with documentation evidencing your\\n    compliance with PCI-DSS and/or PA-DSS upon request. You also\\n    agree that you will use only PCI-DSS and PA-DSS compliant\\n    service providers in connection with the storage or transmission\\n    of Card information, including a cardholder’s account number,\\n    expiration date, and CVV2. You must not store CVV2 data at any\\n    time. Information on PCI-DSS can be found on the [PCI Council’s\\n    website](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/). It is your\\n    responsibility to comply with these standards and all the\\n    Payment Network Rules. We may request additional security measures\\n    at any time and reserve the right to adjust these requirements at\\n    our discretion.\\n\\n13. **Audit Right**\\n    If Shopify believes that a security breach,\\n    personal data breach, or other compromise of data may have\\n    occurred, Shopify may require you to have a third-party auditor\\n    that is approved by Shopify conduct a security audit of your\\n    systems and facilities and issue a report to be provided to\\n    Shopify and, at Shopify’s discretion, to the Processor, its\\n    Financial Services Provider(s), Payment Networks, and law\\n    enforcement, at your sole cost and expense.\\n\\n14. **Privacy**\\n    Your privacy and the protection of your data\\n    are very important to us. You acknowledge that you have\\n    received, read in full, and agree with the terms of our [Privacy\\n    Policy](https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy), our [Data\\n    Processing Addendum](https://www.shopify.com/legal/dpa), and each\\n    Processor’s Privacy Policy (for Stripe see\\n    [here](https://stripe.com/privacy) and for PayPal see\\n    [here](https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/privacy-full?locale.x=en_US)).\\n    Our Privacy Policy and Data Processing Addendum are hereby\\n    incorporated into this Agreement. Shopify’s Privacy Policy and\\n    each Processor’s Privacy Policy contain important information\\n    about the collection, use, retention, and disclosure of personal\\n    information, as well as other important matters, and explains\\n    how and for what purposes we and the Processor collect, use,\\n    retain, disclose and safeguard the information you provide to\\n    us. You agree that Shopify’s Privacy Policy and each Processor’s\\n    Privacy Policy may be modified at Shopify’s or the Processor’s\\n    option, if necessary, and you will check each Privacy Policy on\\n    a regular basis.

Additionally, you\\n    agree that Shopify’s collection, use, retention, and disclosure\\n    of personal information is subject to our Data Processing\\n    Addendum.\\n\\n    We will at all times comply with the provisions of applicable\\n    data protection law, including the EU General Data Protection\\n    Regulation (“GDPR”), as applicable. If we process any of your\\n    personal data when performing our obligations under this\\n    Agreement, we will do so as a “data controller”, as defined by the\\n    GDPR. If we process any Cardholder Data on your behalf, we and you\\n    both agree that it is our intention that you shall be the “data\\n    controller” and we shall be the “data processor” in relation to\\n    that data, as those terms are defined in the GDPR. We shall\\n    process the personal data only in accordance with the terms of\\n    this Agreement and any lawful instructions reasonably given by you\\n    to us from time to time. Additionally, you acknowledge that each\\n    Processor acts as a “data controller”, or as otherwise agreed\\n    between you and the Processor, with regards to any personal data\\n    that they may process under this Agreement and that we are not\\n    responsible for how they process such data.\\n\\n    We will notify you (within a reasonable time frame) if we\\n    receive a request from a person to have access to, or to erase\\n    that person’s personal data, a complaint or request relating to\\n    your obligations under applicable data protection legislation,\\n    or any other communication relating directly to the processing\\n    of any personal data in connection with this Agreement.

Shopify will commingle such accounts and refer to them\\n    together in this Agreement as the “Shopify Payments Account”.\\n\\n    Additionally, when you elect to use a third party sales\\n    channel integration made available through the Shopify\\n    Platform Services (e.g. choosing to sell your products on\\n    Facebook) your transactions on such third party sales channel\\n    (“Third Party Channel”) may be processed by Shopify Payments.\\n    Where Shopify Payments process transactions on your behalf on\\n    a Third Party Channel, you agree and consent to Shopify\\n    sharing or disclosing your data (including personal\\n    information) with the operator of the Third Party Channel in\\n    the context of a data breach or audit, if Shopify is required\\n    to do in connection with its performance of the Payments\\n    Services.\\n\\n    Where a data subject is located in the U.K. or the European\\n    Economic Area that data subject's personal data will be processed\\n    by Shopify International Limited, in accordance with our Privacy\\n    Policy. As part of providing the Payments Services, this personal\\n    data may be transferred to other regions, including to Canada and\\n    the United States. Additionally, in order to process, use, record,\\n    and disclose your personal information, information related to\\n    your business, and Data, we or our agents may transfer such\\n    information to and receive it from the Processor, its Financial\\n    Services Provider(s), or their respective agents and, in so doing,\\n    we may transmit or possess it outside of your jurisdiction.\\n\\n    Additionally, in order to provide the Payments Services, we use\\n    a variety of third party “sub-processors” that fall into many\\n    broad categories—for example, we use sub-processors to help us:\\n    (i) protect you and Shopify from potentially risky transactions,\\n    security threats, or fraud; (ii) perform administrative tasks;\\n    (iii) deliver portions of the Payments Services (e.g., third\\n    parties that work with us to actually process credit card\\n    payments or conduct any shipping); (iv) develop and improve our\\n    products and the Payments Services; (v) generate analytics or\\n    other information relating to the Payments Services; and, (vi)\\n    build our technical infrastructure (e.g., using cloud storage\\n    providers or information security vendors).

As between the\\n    parties to this Agreement, you are solely responsible for\\n    disclosing to your customers that we will collect and process\\n    their Cardholder Data in our supply of the Payments Services to\\n    you, and that in so doing we may transmit or possess it outside\\n    of your or their jurisdiction, and that it may be subject to\\n    disclosure as required by applicable law.\\n\\n    If you receive information about others, including cardholders\\n    and other customers, through the use of the Payments Services,\\n    you must keep such information confidential and only use it in\\n    connection with the Payments Services or as otherwise permitted\\n    by the subject of such information.\\n\\n    You may not disclose or distribute any such information to a\\n    third party or use any such information for marketing purposes\\n    unless you receive the express consent of the subject thereof to\\n    do so.

Processing Card Transactions and Receiving Your Funds\\n\\n1. **Shopify Payments Fees**\\n    You agree to pay the fees for\\n    processing that are set out in your Shopify Admin, which are\\n    incorporated herein by reference (the \\\"Processing Fees\\\").\\n    Processing Fees shall be collected from you by the applicable\\n    Processor on our behalf in accordance with the Processor Terms.\\n\\n    If applicable, fees for POS Equipment are posted here:\\n    [www.shopify.com/pos/hardware](https://www.shopify.com/pos/hardware)\\n    and here:\\n    [www.shopify.com/pricing](https://www.shopify.com/pricing) (the\\n    “POS Equipment Fees”). At our discretion, POS Equipment Fees\\n    will be collected on our behalf by the applicable Processor \\n    pursuant to the Processor Terms or by such other means as we \\n    may prescribe from time to time.\\n\\n    Fees for Shopify Platform Services are collected by Shopify\\n    pursuant to the [Shopify Platform Terms of\\n    Service](https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms) (the \\\"Shopify\\n    Platform Services Fees\\\"). Processing Fees, Equipment Fees, and\\n    Shopify Platform Services Fees shall be referred to herein\\n    collectively as the \\\"Fees\\\".\\n\\n    You are obligated to pay all applicable taxes, fees and other\\n    charges imposed by any governmental authority, including,\\n    without limitation, any value added tax, goods and services tax,\\n    harmonized sales tax and/or provincial or territorial sales tax,\\n    on the Payments Services provided under this Agreement. If you\\n    are tax-exempt, you will provide us with an appropriate\\n    certificate or other evidence of tax exemption that is\\n    satisfactory to us.\\n\\n    We reserve the right to change the Fees at any time, subject to\\n    a thirty (30) day notice period to you in accordance with\\n    Section A19. If you continue to use the Payments Services and\\n    the Processor Services for such thirty (30) days, then you are\\n    deemed to have accepted the change in Fees contemplated by such\\n    notice. Notwithstanding the thirty (30) day notice period referred\\n    to above, if Shopify or the Processor suspends, disables, or\\n    otherwise makes your Shopify Payments Account unavailable to\\n    you, or if you choose to no longer use Shopify Payments, upon\\n    your account being reinstated by Shopify or the Processor,\\n    or if you choose to enable Shopify Payments again, the then\\n    current Fees shall apply to you.\\n\\n    In addition to the Fees, you are also responsible for any\\n    penalties and fines imposed on you or on us by any bank, money\\n    services business, payment network, financial institution, or\\n    other financial intermediary resulting from your use of the\\n    Payments Services in a manner not permitted by this Agreement or\\n    by such financial intermediary’s rules and regulations.\\n\\n2. **Security Interest**\\n    As security for performance of your\\n    obligations under this Agreement, you grant us a first priority\\n    lien and security interest on all funds processed and deposited\\n    into all bank accounts or other financial accounts designated in\\n    your Shopify Admin to receive funds from the settlement of \\n    Transactions (the \\\"Payout Account\\\"), and any other bank accounts associated with your Shopify\\n    Payments Account, and in any funds processed using the Payment\\n    Processing services. These security interests and liens will\\n    secure payment and performance of all of your obligations under\\n    this Agreement and any other agreements now existing or later\\n    entered into between us and you, including, without limitation,\\n    your obligation to pay any amounts due and owing to us. You will\\n    execute, deliver and pay the fees for any documents we request,\\n    and authorize Shopify to take any other action necessary including\\n    registering notice of such security interest in a public registry,\\n    to create, perfect, maintain, and enforce this security interest.\\n\\n3. **Our Collection Rights**\\n    To the extent permitted by law, we\\n    may collect any obligations you owe us under this Agreement by\\n    requesting that a Processor deduct the corresponding amounts\\n    from a Reserve Account (as that term is defined below) or from\\n    funds payable to you arising from the settlement of\\n    Transactions. Fees will be assessed at the time a Transaction is\\n    processed and will be first deducted from the funds received for\\n    such Transaction. If these amounts are not sufficient to meet\\n    your obligations to us, we may charge the payment method\\n    associated with your Shopify Payments Account for any amounts\\n    owed to us. Your failure to fully pay amounts that you owe us on\\n    demand will be a breach of this Agreement. You will be liable\\n    for our costs associated with collection in addition to the\\n    amount owed, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and\\n    expenses, costs of any arbitration or court proceeding,\\n    collection agency fees, and any applicable interest.\\n\\n    Further, we may deduct, or request that a Processor deduct, from\\n    any accounts associated with your Shopify Payments Account,\\n    including the applicable Processor Account or Reserve Account, any\\n    amounts that you owe to us under this Agreement or any other\\n    agreement you have entered into with us or our affiliates. In\\n    accordance with the above and the Processor Terms you authorize us\\n    to debit your Payout Account, without separate notice, to collect\\n    amounts you owe under this Agreement, pursuant to the [User Bank\\n    Account Debit\\n    Authorization](https://stripe.com/legal/bank-debit-authorizations)\\n    and the [Platform Seller Debit\\n    Authorization](https://www.paypal.com/content/terms/shopify-debit-authorization-ach?locale.x=en_US)\\n    (each of which shall form part of the “Processor Terms”).\\n\\n    Additionally, we may require a personal guarantee from a\\n    principal of a business for funds owed under this Agreement. If\\n    we require a personal guarantee we will specifically inform you\\n    in advance.\\n\\n    In addition to the amount due, delinquent accounts may be\\n    charged with fees that are incidental to the collection of\\n    delinquent accounts and chargebacks, including, but not limited\\n    to, collection fees and convenience fees and other third-party\\n    charges.\\n\\n    You hereby explicitly agree that all communication in relation\\n    to delinquent accounts will be made by electronic mail or by\\n    phone, as provided to Shopify by you. Such communication may be\\n    made by Shopify or by anyone on its behalf, including, but not\\n    limited to, a third-party collection agent.\\n\\n4. **Reserves**\\n    Funds held in reserves are amounts of money set\\n    aside to cover chargebacks, refunds, or other payment\\n    obligations under this Agreement (the \\\"Reserve Account\\\"). We, in\\n    our discretion, will set the terms of any Reserve Account and\\n    notify you of such terms, which may require that a certain\\n    amount (including the full amount) of the funds received for a\\n    Transaction are held for a period of time, or that additional\\n    amounts are held in the Reserve Account. We, in our discretion,\\n    may elect to change the terms of a Reserve Account at any\\n    time, for any reason, based on your payment processing history\\n    or as requested by our payment processors.\\n\\n    We may require you to fund the Reserve Account by means of: (i)\\n    any funds payouts made or due to you for Transactions submitted to\\n    the Payments Services; or, (ii) amounts available in your Payout\\n    Account by means of ACH debit;\\n    or, (iii) other sources of funds associated with your Shopify\\n    Payments Account; or, (iv) requesting that you provide funds to us\\n    for deposit to the Reserve Account.\\n\\n    You agree that: (i) you are not entitled to any interest or\\n    other compensation associated with the funds held in the Reserve\\n    Account; (ii) you have no right to direct that account; (iii)\\n    you have no legal interest in those funds or that account; and,\\n    (iv) you may not assign any interest in those funds or that\\n    account.\\n\\n5. **Contesting Chargebacks**\\n    You or Shopify may elect to\\n    contest chargebacks assessed to your account.

Termination and Other General Legal Terms\\n\\n1. **Term**\\n    The Agreement is effective upon the date you agree\\n    to it (by electronically indicating acceptance) and continues so\\n    long as you use the Payments Services or until terminated by you\\n    or by Shopify.\\n\\n2. **Termination**\\n    You may terminate this Agreement by closing\\n    your Shopify Payments Account at any time by following the\\n    instructions in your Shopify Admin. We may terminate this\\n    Agreement and close your Shopify Payments Account at any time,\\n    for any reason, upon notice to you in accordance with Section\\n    A19 above. We may suspend your Shopify Payments Account and your\\n    access to the Payments Services and any rights in respect of\\n    your Shopify Payments Account, or terminate this Agreement, at\\n    any time, for any reason, including if: (i) we determine that\\n    you may be ineligible for the Payments Services because of the\\n    risk associated with your Shopify Payments Account, including,\\n    without limitation, significant credit or fraud risk, or for any\\n    other reason; (ii) you do not comply with any of the provisions\\n    of this Agreement or the Processor Terms; or, (iii) upon request\\n    of the Payment Network, a Processor, or a Card issuer.\\n    Termination of the Processor Terms may, at the discretion of\\n    Shopify, result in a termination of this Agreement. Termination\\n    of this Agreement shall entitle Shopify to cause each Processor\\n    to terminate its Processor Terms.\\n\\n    If a Processor terminates its Processor Terms or indicates its\\n    intention to do so, or if you elect to cease processing with such\\n    Processor, we have the right, but not the obligation, to offer you\\n    a substitute payment processor that is integrated with the Shopify\\n    Payments Account. Upon your acceptance of the terms of service of\\n    such substitute payment processor, they shall be deemed to have\\n    replaced the previous Processor contemplated herein, provided that\\n    your liabilities to such Processor herein shall not be diminished\\n    on account of accepting the terms of the substitute payment\\n    processor.\\n\\n3. **Effects of Termination**\\n    Upon termination and closing of your Shopify Payments Account, \\n    we will immediately discontinue your access to the Payments \\n    Services.

You will not be \\n    refunded the remainder of any Fees that you have paid for\\n    the Payments Services if your access to or use of the Payments\\n    Services is terminated or suspended. Any funds in the Financial\\n    Services Provider’s custody will be paid out to you subject to \\n    the Processor Terms.\\n\\n    Termination does not relieve you of your obligations as defined\\n    in this Agreement, and a Processor may elect to continue to\\n    hold any funds deemed necessary, pending resolution of any other\\n    terms or obligations defined in this Agreement, including, but\\n    not limited to, chargebacks, fees, refunds, or other\\n    investigations or proceedings.\\n\\n    Termination of this Agreement will not necessarily terminate\\n    your Shopify Platform Terms, unless Shopify determines\\n    otherwise.\\n\\n    Upon termination you agree: (i) to immediately cease your use of\\n    the Payments Services; (ii) to discontinue use of any Shopify or\\n    Processor trademarks and to immediately remove any Shopify or\\n    Processor references and logos from your website and/or physical\\n    location, if applicable; (iii) that the license granted under\\n    this Agreement shall end; (iv) that we reserve the right (but\\n    have no obligation) to delete all of your information and\\n    account data stored on our servers; (v) that we will not be\\n    liable to you for compensation, reimbursement, or damages in\\n    connection with your use of the Payments Services, or any\\n    termination or suspension of the Payments Services, or deletion\\n    of your information or account data; and, (vi) that you will\\n    still be liable to us for any fees or fines, or other financial\\n    obligation incurred by you or through your use of the Payments\\n    Services prior to termination.\\n\\n4. **Ownership**\\n    The Payments Services are licensed and not\\n    sold.

If you do not have\\n    sufficient funds in a Reserve Account to cover your liability, you\\n    will be required to immediately add additional funds to such\\n    Reserve Account to cover funds owed to us. If you do not do so, we\\n    may engage in collections efforts to recover such amounts from you\\n    at your cost and expense.\\n\\n6. **Your Representations, Warranties and Covenants**\\n    You represent and warrant to us that: (i) if you are a sole\\n    proprietor, you are at least eighteen (18) years of age or, if\\n    you are a corporation or other entity, that the person entering\\n    into this Agreement on your behalf is at least eighteen (18)\\n    years of age, is authorized to act on your behalf, and has the\\n    authority to bind you to this Agreement; (ii) you are eligible\\n    to register and use the Payments Services and have the right,\\n    power, and ability to enter into and perform under this\\n    Agreement; (iii) the name identified by you when you registered\\n    is your name or business name under which you sell goods and\\n    services and the information that you have provided to us is\\n    accurate and complete; (iv) you are not a member of an organized\\n    crime group, a party who has been a member of an organized crime\\n    group in the past five years, a quasi-member of an organized\\n    crime group, a corporate racketeer, or other similar party, nor\\n    are any of your officers or employees a member of the foregoing;\\n    and, (v) you will not carry out, nor use a third party to carry\\n    out, any of the following unlawful acts: (a) the act of making\\n    violent demands; (b) the act of making unreasonable demands\\n    exceeding legal responsibilities; (c) the act of using\\n    threatening behavior or violence in relation to a transaction;\\n    (d) the act of spreading rumors, using fraudulent means, or\\n    using force to harm the other party’s reputation or obstruct the\\n    party’s business; (e) the act of selling products for the\\n    purpose of money laundering; (f) the act of using a Card held by\\n    you for a sale without reasonable grounds or another act similar\\n    to those set forth in (a) through (f).\\n\\n    You hereby covenant to us that: (i) any Transactions submitted\\n    by you will represent a bona fide sale by you; (ii) any\\n    Transaction submitted by you will accurately describe the goods\\n    and/or services sold and delivered to a customer; (iii) you will\\n    fulfill all of your obligations to each customer for which you\\n    submit a Transaction and will resolve any disputes or complaints\\n    directly with your customers; (iv) you and all Transactions\\n    initiated by you will comply with all applicable laws, rules,\\n    and regulations applicable to your business, including, but not\\n    limited to, any applicable tax laws and regulations; (v) except\\n    in the ordinary course of business, no Transaction submitted by\\n    you through the Payments Services will represent a sale to any\\n    principal, partner, proprietor, or owner of your entity; (vi)\\n    you will not use the Payments Services, directly or indirectly,\\n    for any fraudulent undertaking or in any manner so as to\\n    interfere with the use of the Payments Services; and, (vii) any\\n    information you provide to us will be accurate and complete.\\n\\n7. **NO WARRANTIES**\\n    THE PAYMENTS SERVICES AND ALL ACCOMPANYING\\n    DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS\\\" AND “AS AVAILABLE\\\"\\n    BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR\\n    STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES\\n    OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND\\n    NON-INFRINGEMENT.
