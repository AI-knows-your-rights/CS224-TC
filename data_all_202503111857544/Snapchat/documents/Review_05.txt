Community GuidelinesPolicy CenterCommunity GuidelinesAt Snap, we empower people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together. We created these Community Guidelines to encourage self-expression while helping Snapchatters stay safe. We want these guidelines to be clear and easy to understand. As noted in our Terms of Service, these guidelines are part of your contract with Snap and you must follow them. Please see our Terms of Service and check your local laws to make sure you are old enough to join our community. Note About Severe HarmWhile we prohibit all content or behavior that violates our Community Guidelines, we are especially concerned with violations that pose a risk of severe harm to Snapchatters. We disable accounts we identify engaging in such behavior. Guidance about what we consider to be severe harm and how we take action against it is available. Learn MoreLearn MoreCommunity Guidelines apply to all users and all contentThese guidelines apply to all content and all Snapchatters. This includes usernames and display names, text, images, videos, generative AI, links or attachments, emojis, Lenses and other creative tools, and all behavior on Snapchat. Snap offers generative AI features through our services. We implement safeguards designed to help keep generative AI content in line with our Community Guidelines. We also expect Snapchatters to use AI responsibly. We reserve the right to take appropriate enforcement action against accounts that use AI to violate our Community Guidelines or abuse our AI products. This can include termination of an account. In addition to our Community Guidelines, advertisers and media partners must comply with further guidelines. For example, their content must be accurate and, where appropriate, fact-checked. Developers are also subject to additional rules. We've outlined here and in our Terms of Service specific rules for content that is prohibited on Snapchat. We work to ensure these rules are applied consistently. When applying them, we take into account the nature of the content, including whether it is newsworthy, factual, and relates to a matter of political, social, or educational value. Additional context about how we moderate content and enforce our policies is available here. We also provide links to more detailed information about our Community Guidelines in each of the sections below. We want Snapchat to be a safe and positive experience for everyone. We reserve the right to decide, at our sole discretion, what content or behavior violates the spirit of our rules. While we have the right to review, moderate, or remove any content from our platform, we do not proactively review all of it. We cannot guarantee that other users will comply with our Community Guidelines or that our platform will be free of violating content. We strongly encourage Snapchatters to report any content that may be violating so that our teams can review and take appropriate action. Community Guidelinesapply to all content and behavior on Snapchat's platform and products, and cover the following topics:Sexual ContentWe prohibit any activity that involves sexual exploitation or abuse of a minor, including sharing child sexual exploitation or abuse imagery, grooming, or sexual extortion (sextortion), or the sexualization of children. We report all identified instances of child sexual exploitation to authorities, including attempts to engage in such conduct. Never post, save, send, forward, distribute, or ask for nude or sexually explicit content involving anyone under the age of 18 (this includes sending or saving such images of yourself). We prohibit promoting, distributing, or sharing pornographic content, as well as commercial activities that relate to pornography or sexual interactions (whether online or offline). Breastfeeding and other depictions of nudity in non-sexual contexts are generally permitted. Learn MoreThreats, Violence, & HarmEncouraging or engaging in violent or dangerous behavior is prohibited. Never intimidate or threaten to harm a person, a group of people, or someone’s property. Snaps of gratuitous or graphic violence, including animal abuse, are not allowed. We don’t allow the glorification of self-harm, including the promotion of self-injury, suicide, or eating disorders. Learn MoreHateful Content, Terrorism, and Violent ExtremismTerrorist organizations, violent extremists, and hate groups are prohibited from using our platform. We have no tolerance for content that advocates or advances terrorism or violent extremism. Hate speech or content that demeans, defames, or promotes discrimination or violence on the basis of race, color, caste, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, disability, or veteran status, immigration status, socio-economic status, age, weight, or pregnancy status is prohibited. Read NextHarassment and BullyingWe prohibit bullying or harassment of any kind. This extends to all forms of sexual harassment, including sending unwanted sexually explicit, suggestive, or nude images to other users. If someone blocks you, you may not contact them from another Snapchat account. Sharing images of a person in a private space — like a bathroom, bedroom, locker room, or medical facility — without their knowledge and consent is prohibited, as is sharing another person’s private information without their knowledge and consent or for the purpose of harassment (i. e. , “doxxing”). If someone is depicted in your Snap and asks you to remove it, please do! Respect the privacy rights of others. Please also do not harass another Snapchatter by abusing our reporting mechanisms, such as intentionally reporting content that is permissible. Learn MoreIllegal or Regulated ActivitiesDon’t use Snapchat to send or post content that’s illegal in your jurisdiction, or for any illegal activity. This includes promoting, facilitating, or participating in criminal activity, such as buying, selling, exchanging, or facilitating sales of illegal or regulated drugs, contraband (such as child sexual exploitation or abuse imagery), weapons, or counterfeit goods or documents. It also includes promoting or facilitating any form of exploitation, including sex trafficking, labor trafficking, or other human trafficking. We prohibit the illegal promotion of regulated goods or industries, including unauthorized promotion of gambling, tobacco or vape products, and alcohol. Learn MoreHarmful False or Deceptive InformationWe prohibit spreading false information that causes harm or is malicious, such as denying the existence of tragic events, unsubstantiated medical claims, undermining the integrity of civic processes, or manipulating content for false or misleading purposes (whether through generative AI or through deceptive editing). We prohibit pretending to be someone (or something) that you’re not, or attempting to deceive people about who you are. This includes impersonating your friends, celebrities, public figures, brands, or other people or organizations for harmful, non-satirical purposes. We prohibit spam, including undisclosed paid or sponsored content, pay-for-follower promotions or other follower-growth schemes, the promotion of spam applications, or the promotion of multilevel marketing or pyramid schemes. We prohibit fraud and other deceptive practices, including the promotion of fraudulent goods or services or get-rich-quick schemes, or imitating Snapchat or Snap Inc. Learn MoreInformation and Q&AHow can I report something? You can always submit a report to our safety teams using our in-app reporting features or by completing this form, which allows you to report a concern whether you have a Snapchat account or not. We review these reports to determine violations of these guidelines. What happens if I violate the Community Guidelines? If you violate these Community Guidelines, we may remove the offending content, terminate or limit the visibility of your account, and/or notify law enforcement. Our policy is to refer information to law enforcement, potentially including relevant content and other account data, when we believe activity poses an imminent threat to human life.

Snap reserves the right to remove or restrict account access for users whom we have reason to believe, in our sole discretion, pose a danger to others, on or off of Snapchat. Examples include convicted sex offenders, leaders of terrorist organizations, individuals who incite violence or perpetrate severe harms against others, or behavior that we believe poses a threat to human life. In evaluating such behavior, we may consider guidance from other sources, such as subject matter experts or law enforcement, in determining whether to remove or restrict account access.
