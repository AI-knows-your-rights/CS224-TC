If you sign up for a Kindle Unlimited membership, you accept these terms, conditions, limitations and requirements on behalf of yourself and all members of your household and others who use Kindle Unlimited under your account.

From time to time, we may add or remove titles from the program and we make no guarantee as to the availability of specific titles or the minimum number of titles available. If you are located outside of the United States, the program may not be available to you. If your membership ends, you will no longer have access to the titles you selected from the program. Fees and Renewal The membership fees for Kindle Unlimited are stated in our Help pages. From time to time, we may offer different membership terms, and the fees for such membership may vary. Membership fees may be subject to tax and are non-refundable except as expressly set forth in these Terms. If you sign up for your Kindle Unlimited membership through us and are billed directly by us, then the billing terms described below will apply to your membership: Unless you notify us before a charge that you want to cancel or do not want to auto renew, you understand your Kindle Unlimited membership will automatically continue and you authorize us (without notice to you, unless required by applicable law) to collect the then-applicable membership fees and any taxes, using any payment method we have on record for you. If all payment methods we have on file for you are declined for payment of your membership fees, your membership will be cancelled unless you provide us with a new payment method. If you provide us with a new payment method and are successfully charged before your membership is cancelled, your new membership period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge. If you sign up for your Kindle Unlimited membership through a third party and are not billed directly by us, then the billing terms provided by that third party will apply to your membership. We may change the Kindle Unlimited membership fee from time to time by notifying you of the change and effective date before it takes effect. At any time before a membership fee change takes effect, you may reject the change by cancelling your membership at no additional cost in accordance with the Membership Cancellation section below. From time to time we may also offer non-recurring memberships. The provisions in this section regarding automatic renewal are not applicable to those memberships. Membership Cancellation If you sign up for your Kindle Unlimited membership through us and are billed directly by us, you may cancel your membership by visiting https://www. amazon. com/kucentral, clicking the 'Cancel Membership' button and following the instructions on your screen, or by contacting our Customer Service team. If you cancel your membership, (i) you will not receive a refund of any membership fees already paid, and (ii) you will continue to have access to your membership benefits until the end of your subscription period. If you cancel your membership before the renewal date, you will not be charged for the next subscription period.

If you sign up for your Kindle Unlimited membership through a third party, you may need to contact the third party to cancel your membership or receive any refund under that third party’s applicable policies. Restrictions We reserve the right to accept or refuse membership in our discretion. You may not transfer or assign your membership or any Kindle Unlimited benefits. We may take reasonable actions necessary to prevent fraud, including placing restrictions on the number of titles that can be accessed from the program at any one time. Promotional Trial Memberships We sometimes offer certain customers various trial or other promotional memberships, which are subject to these Terms except as otherwise stated in the promotional offers.

Termination by Us We may terminate your membership at our discretion without notice. If we do so, we will give you a prorated refund based on the number days remaining in your membership. However, we will not give any refund for termination related to conduct that we determine, in our discretion, violates these Terms or any applicable law, involves fraud or misuse of the membership, or is harmful to our interests or another user. Our failure to insist upon or enforce your strict compliance with these Terms will not constitute a waiver of any of our rights. Disputes; Limitation of Liability Any dispute or claim arising from or relating to these Terms or your membership is subject to the dispute resolution, governing law, disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability and all other terms in the Amazon. com Conditions of Use.

Please note that your use of the Amazon. com website and your Kindle Unlimited membership are also governed by the agreements listed and linked to below, as well as all other applicable terms, conditions, limitations, and requirements on the Amazon. com website, all of which (as changed over time) are incorporated into these Terms. If you sign up for a Kindle Unlimited membership, you accept these terms, conditions, limitations and requirements on behalf of yourself and all members of your household and others who use Kindle Unlimited under your account. Amazon. com Conditions of Use Amazon. com Privacy Notice Kindle Store Terms of Use Audible Service Conditions of Use The Program As a member of Kindle Unlimited, you may read Kindle books and listen to Audible audiobooks from a designated list of titles an unlimited number of times for so long as you are a member of the program. From time to time, we may add or remove titles from the program and we make no guarantee as to the availability of specific titles or the minimum number of titles available. If you are located outside of the United States, the program may not be available to you. If your membership ends, you will no longer have access to the titles you selected from the program.

Membership fees may be subject to tax and are non-refundable except as expressly set forth in these Terms. If you sign up for your Kindle Unlimited membership through us and are billed directly by us, then the billing terms described below will apply to your membership: Unless you notify us before a charge that you want to cancel or do not want to auto renew, you understand your Kindle Unlimited membership will automatically continue and you authorize us (without notice to you, unless required by applicable law) to collect the then-applicable membership fees and any taxes, using any payment method we have on record for you. If all payment methods we have on file for you are declined for payment of your membership fees, your membership will be cancelled unless you provide us with a new payment method. If you provide us with a new payment method and are successfully charged before your membership is cancelled, your new membership period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge.
