If we determine you fraudulently obtain or use any Tokens, we may revoke those Tokens and charge your credit card or other payment instrument for any products redeemed using those Tokens. Amazon's failure to insist upon or enforce your strict compliance with this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any of its rights. Changes to Service; Amendments.

We may amend any of this Agreement's terms at our sole discretion by posting the revised terms on the Amazon. com website.

Some Kindle Content, such as interactive or highly formatted content, may not be available to you on all Kindle Software. Limitations. Unless specifically indicated otherwise, you may not sell, rent, lease, distribute, broadcast, sublicense, or otherwise assign any rights to the Kindle Content or any portion of it to any third party, and you may not remove or modify any proprietary notices or labels on the Kindle Content.

We are not responsible if any Tokens are used without your permission. Purchases and Returns. Purchases of Tokens will be charged to the 1-Click payment method associated with your Amazon account. All purchases of Tokens are final. We do not accept returns of Tokens except where required by law. If you believe any purchased Tokens were not properly credited to your account, please contact Amazon customer service for assistance. If we offer discounts on the purchase of Tokens, we may modify or discontinue those discounts at any time without notice to you. Restrictions. Tokens are a digital good and have no monetary value (i. e. , are not cash or equivalent), and do not constitute currency or property of any type. Tokens can only be redeemed for eligible Kindle Vella digital products we offer through the Kindle Store. Tokens cannot be resold, transferred for value, or redeemed for cash, except to the extent required by law. Tokens in one Amazon account may not be transferred to another Amazon account. We may limit the number of Tokens you can purchase or receive within certain periods of time, or implement other restrictions on the receipt or use of Tokens. If we give you Tokens in connection with your purchase of a product and you later return or receive a refund for that product, we may revoke those Tokens. If you have already used those Tokens, we may deduct the same number of Tokens from your account or charge your credit card or other payment instrument for any products you redeemed using those Tokens.
