Backup data can be used to quickly set up a new device or to restore your existing device after a reset. We'll expand this feature over time so that additional items are backed up. How is my backup data stored? Backup data is encrypted and stored in the Cloud. Backup data can be used to help you easily set up a new device or restore data to your existing device after a reset. We seek to make your backup data available for at least a year from the last time you used your device. Can I turn off Backup and Restore and delete my backup data? Yes. You can disable Backup and Restore for any Amazon account registered on your device by going to Settings > Device Options > Backup & Restore and tapping "OFF". Once disabled, backup data currently associated with your device and Amazon account will be deleted.
