Events beyond our reasonable control (such as changes in service or terms by wireless carriers) may impact the terms or circumstances under which we provide you wireless connectivity and may result in a temporary or permanent modification or loss of wireless connectivity for your Kindle. 3. Generala. Information Received. The Software will provide Amazon with information about use of your Amazon Device and its interaction with Digital Content and the Services (such as last page read, content archiving, available memory, up-time, log files, network diagnostics, content usage, viewing data, search queries, location, voice information, connectivity and signal strength). Information provided to Amazon may be processed in the cloud to improve your experience and our products and services, and may be stored on servers outside the country in which you live. We will handle any information we receive in accordance with the Amazon. com Privacy Notice (https://www. amazon. com/privacy). b. Information Provided To Others. You are responsible for any information you provide to others, including third-party Digital Content providers, using an Amazon Device. Use of information you provide to these third parties will be subject to any privacy notice or other terms that they may provide to you. c. Functionality; Content. The Software may use machine learning models to interpret and provide responses to your requests. We use a variety of data sources to train these models and provide responses to your requests, including Amazon content, content from the use of our services, content licensed from third parties, and content publicly available on the internet. These machine learning models may produce content that is based, in part, on patterns in data used to train these models. The Software may provide responses that do not represent Amazon’s views. The Software may also get things wrong, including by failing to take a requested action or taking an action different from what you requested. We do not guarantee that the Software or its functionality or content (including traffic, health, or stock information) is accurate, reliable, always available, or complete. You may encounter content through the Software that you find inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable. Amazon has no responsibility or liability for such content. d. Changes to Services; Amendments. We may change, suspend, or discontinue the Services, or any part of them, at any time without notice. We may amend any of this Agreement's terms at our sole discretion by posting the revised terms on the Amazon. com website. Your continued use of the Amazon Device after the effective date of the revised Agreement constitutes your acceptance of the terms. e. Termination. Your rights under this Agreement will automatically terminate without notice if you fail to comply with any of its terms. In case of such termination, Amazon may immediately revoke your access to the Services without refund of any fees. Amazon's failure to insist upon or enforce your strict compliance with this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any of its rights. f. Disputes. Any dispute or claim arising from or relating to this Agreement, an Amazon Device, the Software, the Digital Content, or the Services is subject to the dispute resolution, governing law, disclaimer of warranties, limitation of liability, and all other terms in the Amazon. com Conditions of Use (https://www. amazon. com/conditionsofuse). g. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. Without limiting the Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability terms in the Amazon. com Conditions of Use, (1) unless otherwise provided by Amazon, your Amazon Device may be subject to a limited warranty, and (2) unless otherwise required by applicable law, in no event will our or our licensors' aggregate liability for any claim arising from or relating to this Agreement or use of your Amazon Device with respect to any claim exceed the greater of fifty dollars ($50. 00) and the amount you actually paid for your Amazon Device. h. Contact Information. For help with your Amazon Device, the Services, Digital Content, Software or resolving other issues, please contact Customer Service at https://www. amazon. com/contact-us/.

By using the Amazon Device, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement on behalf of yourself and all members of your household and others who use the Amazon Device or Services under your account. If you do not accept the terms of this Agreement, then you may not use the Amazon Device, and you may return it in accordance with the applicable return policy. You may need your own Amazon. com account to register and use your Amazon Device, and you may be required to be logged in to the account and have a valid payment method associated with it. Your use of any of the Services is subject to any additional rules, policies and terms that apply to those Services. For the purpose of these Amazon Device Terms of Use: "Amazon Device" means each device manufactured by Amazon that links to this Agreement or otherwise includes this Agreement in its documentation such as Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, Amazon Fire TV devices (but, for clarity, not Fire TV devices developed and manufactured by a third party, such as Fire TV Edition devices), Amazon Echo devices, Amazon Luna Controller, Amazon Astro, Amazon Glow, Amazon Tap, Amazon Dash Button, Amazon Dash Wand, Amazon Smart Plug, Amazon Smart Soap Dispenser, Amazon Smart Air Quality Monitor, Amazon Smart Thermostat, and all Alexa-enabled Amazon Basics products, and, in each case, any Amazon accessories for these devices. "Digital Content" means digitized content (including third-party content), such as books, newspapers, magazines, journals, music, videos, apps, games, skills, photos, audio, and related features and functionality. "Services" means our provision of Digital Content, Software, and support and other services that we provide Amazon Device users, including the wireless connectivity that we provide Kindle users. "Software" means all software we make available to you for use on an Amazon Device, but excludes third-party Digital Content. 1. Features and Software a. Location Services. Your Amazon Device may have a feature that allows maps, other applications, and Amazon to use and access location and related information from your device. Learn more about location services at https://www. amazon. com/locationservices/faq. If you are using location services on your Amazon Device for navigation, you are solely responsible for driving safely, observing all traffic rules, and using your own judgment while driving and selecting routes. Amazon does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any location services. b. Backup and Restore. Your Amazon Device may have a feature that backs up to the cloud certain data on your device, including account settings, notes, email and wireless configurations, bookmarks, search history, communications, and call history, so that you can restore that data later to an Amazon Device. Learn more about backup and restore at https://www. amazon. com/backup/faq. c. Voice Services. Your Amazon Device may have features that allow you to access Alexa voice services or otherwise use your voice to perform certain tasks, such as check the weather, add a calendar entry, perform a search, or operate other connected products. When you use voice services, we may process your voice input and other information (such as location) in the cloud to respond to your requests and to improve your experience and our products and services. Your use of Alexa is subject to the Alexa Terms of Use (https://www. amazon. com/alexa/terms). Learn more about Alexa voice services and how it works at https://www. amazon. com/alexa/voice, including wake word processing, and how to delete voice recordings associated with your account. d. Other Image, Video, and Audio Services. Some Amazon Devices, such as Echo Show and Fire tablets with Firefly, have features that allow you to capture images, video, or audio. When you use these features, we may process and store your captured images, video, or audio in the cloud to provide and improve our products and services. For some Amazon Devices and features, we may limit cloud storage or offer service plans with different storage limits and fees. Learn more about Firefly, including how to delete images and audio associated with your account, at https://www. amazon. com/firefly/faq. e. Recording Services. Your Amazon Device may have features that allow you to record and play back certain Digital Content, such as over-the-air TV content received through an antenna connected to your Fire TV Recast. You may only use these recording services for your personal, non-commercial use, and you may only pair your Fire TV Recast with a device that you own or control. You are responsible for complying with any copyright and other laws applicable to your use of the recording services. Your ability to access or use your Fire TV Recast outside the United States may be limited. We are not liable for any failure to record, loss of, or damage to, content. Learn more about Fire TV Recast and how it works at https://www. amazon. com/firetvrecast/faq. f. Use of the Software. Except as provided in this section, you may use the Software only on an Amazon Device. For additional terms that apply to the Software, see the Additional Amazon Software Terms contained in the Amazon. com Conditions of Use (https://www. amazon. com/conditionsofuse) and the terms contained in the Legal or similar section in the Settings menu of your Amazon Device or companion app. Software licensed under an open source license is governed solely by the terms of that open source license. g. Fingerprint ID. Certain Fire tablet devices have a Fingerprint ID feature that allows you to automatically unlock your tablet and verify yourself in apps by touching the fingerprint sensor on the tablet. If you enroll in this feature, Fingerprint ID uses images of your fingerprint to create a fingerprint template and to update that template over time to improve the feature’s ability to recognize you. This fingerprint template is stored on your device and you can delete it at any time in the Settings menu of your Fire tablet. Learn more about Fingerprint ID and how it works at https://www. amazon. com/tabletfingerprintfaq. 2. Connectivity and Availability a. Internet and Wireless Connectivity. Your Amazon Device may require an Internet connection or data plan from a third-party provider in order to use some features. In such cases, your Internet connection or data plan is subject to the fees, restrictions, terms and limitations imposed by your provider. b. Availability. Some Services may be unavailable, vary (by device or geography, for example), be offered for a limited time, or require separate subscriptions. In addition, if your Amazon Device requires wireless data services and is located in an area where it cannot access such services, you may not be able to use some or all of the Services or other features of your Amazon Device. We are not responsible for the unavailability of wireless data services or any corresponding loss of Services. c. Kindle e-Reader Connectivity. The Kindle e-Reader uses wireless connectivity to allow you to shop for, download, browse and use Digital Content. If your Kindle is not subject to a data plan or other third-party fees, we generally do not charge you for use of wireless connectivity. However, your Kindle may use wireless connectivity to make other services available to you for which we may charge you a fee, such as personal file download and subscriptions when you are located in another country. The fees and terms for such services are available at the Amazon. com website or on or through your Kindle and may change from time to time. You may use the wireless connectivity provided by us only in connection with Digital Content, Software, and support and other services that we provide Kindle users as permitted by this Agreement and not for any other purpose. Events beyond our reasonable control (such as changes in service or terms by wireless carriers) may impact the terms or circumstances under which we provide you wireless connectivity and may result in a temporary or permanent modification or loss of wireless connectivity for your Kindle. 3.
