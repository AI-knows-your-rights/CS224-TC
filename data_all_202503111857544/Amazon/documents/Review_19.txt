As explained in the Amazon Privacy Notice and AWS Privacy Notice , we sometimes provide personal information to third parties to perform services on our behalf. If we transfer personal information received under the EU-US DPF, UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, and the Swiss-US DPF to a third party, the third party's access, use, and disclosure of the personal information must also be in compliance with our DPF obligations, and we will remain liable under the EU-US DPF, UK Extension to the EU-US DPF, and the Swiss-US DPF for any failure to do so by the third party unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. You can read about the right to access your personal information and the choices and means available to you to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information in the Amazon Privacy Notice and AWS Privacy Notice. You can read more about the DPF Principles and the DPF Panel, and review our DPF registration, at the Data Privacy Framework Program page.
