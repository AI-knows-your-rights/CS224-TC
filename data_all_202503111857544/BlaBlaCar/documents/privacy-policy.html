<p><strong>Version applicable from 18 February 2025</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. General</strong><br />
Comuto SA (hereinafter, “BlaBlaCar”), (whose registered office is located at 84, avenue de la République, 75011 Paris, France) attaches great importance to the protection and respect of your privacy.<br />
BlaBlaCar has developed a ridesharing platform accessible on a website or in the form of a mobile application, and designed to (i) (i) to put drivers travelling to a given destination in contact with passengers going in the same direction, in order to enable them to share the Trip and therefore the associated costs, (ii) to book tickets for bus trips operated by Bus Operators (the “Bus Operators”) and (iii) search for and make the purchase from BlaBlaCar Train Tickets from the train operators (the “Rail Companies”) that we distribute (hereinafter, the “Platform”).<br />
Comuto SA acts as a data controller regarding the collection, use and sharing of the information that you provide to us through the Platform.<br />
In the event that you purchase Bus Tickets or Train Tickets, your personal data will be transmitted respectively to the Bus Operators or Rail Companies which act as separate data controllers.

<h2>7. Is your Information being transferred, how and where?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In principle, we store the Personal Data that we hold about you in the European Union (“<strong>EU</strong>&#8220;). However, since for example some of our service providers are based in countries outside of the European Union (“third countries”), we also transfer some of your data to third countries. This may include third countries where the European Commission has not taken the decision that such third country ensures an adequate level of protection. In that case, we ensure that the transfer is performed in accordance with the applicable legislation and that appropriate safeguards have been put in place (especially standard contractual clauses as issued by the European Commission) in order to guarantee a sufficient level of protection of individuals’ private life and fundamental rights.</p>
<p>By sending a request to the Group Data Protection Officer (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="fd999c899c8d8f9289989e89949293bd9f919c9f919c9e9c8fd39e9290">[email&#160;protected]</a>), we can provide you with the details regarding such appropriate safeguards (for example, the standard contractual clauses issued by the European Commission).</p>
