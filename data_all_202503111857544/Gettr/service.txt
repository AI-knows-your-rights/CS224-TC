"The moral rights include the right of attribution, the right to have a work published anonymously or pseudonymously, and the right to the integrity of the work. The preserving of the integrity of the work allows the author to object to alteration, distortion, or mutilation of the work that is "prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation". Anything else that may detract from the artist's relationship with the work even after it leaves the artist's possession or ownership may bring these moral rights into play. Moral rights are distinct from any economic rights tied to copyrights. Even if an artist has assigned his or her copyright rights to a work to a third party, he or she still maintains the moral rights to the work." -Wikipedia In general, any terms that use the exact words "moral rights" as rights that are waived will fall under this Case. â€¢ You arenâ€™t allowed to remove or edit user-generated content You cannot edit or remove your content from this service. â€¢ Specific content can be deleted without reason and may be removed without prior notice This service can delete specific content.

The Service infers your acceptance from your continued usage, instead of prompting you to read the new Terms and asking for direct consent. This doesnâ€™t apply to services that have no way to seek consent from users through their contact details or an account. â€¢ Your content can be licensed to third parties By posting content through the Services, users grant them a transferable and/or sublicensable right, which allows user content to be licensed to third parties. â€¢ Your personal data may be sold or otherwise transferred as part of a bankruptcy proceeding or other type of financial transaction If the service gets acquired or is involved in a merger, bankruptcy, reorganisation or sale, your personal data may be transferred or sold. â€¢ Your personal data may be used for marketing purposes The service may use your personal data for marketing, such as sending you personalised offerings. â€¢ A license is kept on user-generated content even after you close your account The service may still use your content and display it after you stopped using it by closing your account. The case applies to terms requiring users to grant them a perpetual license over that content. â€¢ Information is gathered about you through third parties This Service may employ, either identifiable or non-identifiable, data collection from third party sources about you. â€¢ You are tracked via web beacons, tracking pixels, browser fingerprinting, and/or device fingerprinting Tracking technologies (such as web beacons, tracking pixels...) are employed on users and/or the service assigns a unique ID to a browser or device to track its behaviour. â€¢ Your profile is combined across various products When using multiple services from one same company, they can combine these (unrelated) information sources about you to build up a single richer user profile about you. â€¢ You are forced into binding arbitration in case of disputes unless you mail a letter opting out within 5 days This service forces users to use their own contracted arbitrator and forces users to waive their rights to jury trial. â€¢ You waive your right to a class action. The right to be represented in a class action (or representative action) exists in the US and some European countries. It allows people who have been similarly injured by the same accused to take legal action by a single lawsuit instead of individually. Some Terms of Service try to limit that right. By agreeing to them, you could waive (= renounce to) your right to a class action, which might reduce your chances to be successful in a case. â€¢ Your personal information is used for many different purposes Personal Data can be processed for many reasons, including non essential processing such as for advertising, marketing and analytics purposes. â€¢ Per the service's terms, you may not express negative opinions about them Criticising, questioning, making objections or complaints about the Service, its staff or anything related to it is prohibited and constitutes a breach of the Terms. â€¢ Your data may be processed and stored anywhere in the world Your data is stored all over the world, including in countries where data protection rules may differ from the ones of the service's jurisdiction or those of your country jurisdiction. â€¢ The service is only available in some countries approved by its government Countries under embargo or banned by the government of the country in question cannot use the service. â€¢ Usernames can be rejected or changed for any reason The service's terms explain they may change or remove usernames at their sole discretion, and they may do so without prior notice. â€¢ Any liability on behalf of the service is only limited to the fees you paid as a user â€¢ You can access most of the pages on the service's website without revealing any personal information The service does not require users to reveal personal information for most of its website.
