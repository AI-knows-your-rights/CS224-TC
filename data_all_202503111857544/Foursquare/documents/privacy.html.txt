Your Privacy Choices – US Consumers In the US, the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) have established rules about interest-based advertising, including cross-device linking for such advertising.

Cross-device linking is the practice of associating different browsers and/or devices (such as mobile devices and televisions) based on information about the potential relationships among them. You may have the right to opt-out of seeing interest-based ads from us, or our Business Partners, Developers & Enterprise Customers that are delivered on various platforms. To do so, please visit: – Desktop/Mobile Web Browser – DAA WebChoices or NAI Consumer Opt-Out – Connected TVs/TV Streaming Devices – NAI Connected TV Choices– Mobile Apps – DAA AppChoices iOS, DAA AppChoices Android, DAA AppChoices Amazon.

Visits – When you opt-in to the collection and sharing of precise geolocation data from your mobile device, we may use your data to create an inferred visit to that location, which we call a “Visit. ” Targeting (Audience) – Using our Visits, along with inferences about your interests, location and other demographics that we derive from the data we have about you, we create “Audiences. ” Audiences may be used to send you advertisements tailored to your inferred interests.

Proximity may be used to send advertisements to your device when it is detected near a point of interest. Attribution – We also help brands measure the effectiveness of their advertisement campaigns by attributing purchases or other actions, such as a store visit, to their ads by matching ad impressions to such actions. As part of Attribution, we may also associate devices that we believe are related to each other. Aggregated Products and Services – We may also use your data in an aggregated manner to power products and services that offer movement- and location-based insights and trends.
