Documents



â€¢ The service can delete specific content without reason and may do it without prior notice



This service can delete specific content. Usually they will claim they reserve the right to do it at their sole discretion, which is legalese for saying they won't give a specific reason. If the terms say they will not notify you, it shall be included in the quote but if it does not explicitly say they will give you a notice, it can be reasonably inferred that they can do it without telling you.
â€¢ The service may sell your data unless you opt out



There is a form to opt-out (typically California's CCPA) of the selling of your personal data. This is a bad a point because there are many services that don't have this form due to not selling your data in the first place.
â€¢ You waive your right to a class action.



The right to be represented in a class action (or representative action) exists in the US and some European countries. It allows people who have been similarly injured by the same accused to take legal action by a single lawsuit instead of individually. Some Terms of Service try to limit that right. By agreeing to them, you could waive (= renounce to) your right to a class action, which might reduce your chances to be successful in a case.

These types of cookies/pixels send information to social media sites when you interact with the service.

If you wish to bring legal action against a service about a past incident, you may not be able to do so if the Terms you agreed to implied a limited amount of time.

â€¢ This service forces users into binding arbitration in the case of disputes



This service forces users to use their own contracted arbitrator and forces users to waive their rights to jury trial.
â€¢ Instead of asking directly, this Service will assume your consent merely from your usage.

â€¢ You can limit how your information is used by third-parties and the service
