Additional Privacy Notice for California ResidentsHow do we use Artificial Intelligence?
We use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) algorithms to support and develop features to provide you services and improve the quality of the services.
Our processing of data may include some automated and some human (or manual) methods of processing.
The automated processing typically includes features aimed at completing manual, repetitive tasks more efficiently.
For example, we may use AI features to detect security risks, synthesize information for customer service agents, and help therapists manage and document sessions more effectively.
We expect these improvements to ultimately improve our services and experiences for Members and Therapists.
To help ensure these tools remain fair and accurate, as well as protect the privacy of our Members and Therapists, we either thoroughly review a model or build it internally and, unless you agree otherwise, do not use any Therapy Data, such as sessions data, journal entries, messages, worksheets, or any other type of private communication you have with your Therapist in a session to train an AI or NLU model.
SECTION 2Data SharingWhat are the purposes for sharing my data?
Here's some more information about the purposes for which we share your data:Your data may be shared to comply with applicable laws.
For example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena.
This is not unique to BetterHelp and is applicable to in-person therapy as well.
Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them.
Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that.
We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.
Occasionally, your data may be handled by a select number of employees who are part of our parent company for support services.
These employees are under strict duties of confidentiality.
For example, a paralegal at our parent company may receive subpoenas or legal correspondence on behalf of Members or former Members and make sure they are provided to BetterHelp's Legal team to address.
We may share certain data with Service Providers12 that provide limited services that help us operate the Platform.
Examples include:Data hosting and storage providers: For example, cloud hosting providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Technology Service Providers: For example, we sometimes integrate tools into our Platform which give our Platform more functionality, like technology that helps us provide live audio, video and group meetings.
Customer Service Providers: For example, we use a tool that helps keep track of requests and questions from our Members, visitors and Therapists in a secure way.
Email management and communication Service Providers.
Email management and communication Service Providers: For example, we may use a tool that makes reaching out to you easier for us and more convenient for you.
Marketing and advertising Service Providers: For example, we may partner with an agency to run a marketing campaign or to help us better understand how to run our own campaigns to reach more people who may be interested in starting therapy.
Remember that Service Providers can only legally use data at our direction - no other person or company can authorize how they use it and they cannot disclose data that is individually identifiable to any other person or company, other than to us or the Service Providers' own subcontractors provided that they're bound to data Processing terms that are no less restrictive than the Service Provider's terms.
Billing and payment processing Service Providers: For example, we use Stripe to help process payments in a secure way.
Stripe also assists us in paying Therapists and issuing tax documents to them.
For this purpose, we may share email addresses of Therapists with Stripe and other data that is needed to pay Therapists such as a Therapist's name and tax ID.
Reporting and analytics Service Providers: For example, we might use a service to help us keep track of which pages and features are most used on our site.
Advisors and lawyers: To assist with business matters.
We may share some of your data with Service Providers to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and that of our users.
If you're a Therapist on our Platform, or being recruited to join us, in addition to the above, we may share certain data with Therapist recruiters in order to facilitate, monitor, and track the recruitment process.
If you are a Therapist on our Platform, we may also share certain data such as information you volunteer in or through the Platform including, but not limited to, your name, photograph, NPI (if applicable), information about your credentials, experience, specialties and qualifications with insurance payors or health plans for the purposes of contracting with them.
We may also share this information with vendors that accreditate/certify our therapist credentialing processes and otherwise help us streamline the credentialing process.
For Members who receive services in connection with an employer, organization, or other business partner, we may share group-level usage data, which cannot be directly connected to you, with your organization.
In the instance of Members who receive services through an Employee Assistance Program (“EAP”), your EAP will provide notice for any individual-level data which is shared with the EAP, if you are utilizing one and have provided them with consent for us to do so.
If you have any questions on how your data will be used by or shared with your EAP, please reach out to your EAP directly.
We may share some of your data in connection with an asset sale, merger or bankruptcy.
Note that if you make any information publicly available on the Platform, such as with a public post, anyone may see and use such information.
If you opt in to "Analytics (previously "Performance cookies")", we may use analytics cookies and other tracking technologies to share your data with trusted Service Providers that assist us to Process1 data for activities including but not limited to analyzing traffic sources, visits, and site interactions.
This analysis helps us to improve our products and services.
If you opt in to "Advertising (previously "Targeting cookies")" information regarding your activity on our websites, excluding activity when you're logged in and have started therapy, may be shared for advertising purposes.
For more information about your specific settings, see here.
To learn more, see section: "Are you using my data for advertising?
"How do you use my data to comply with the law?
When required by law, we cooperate with government agencies.
This is not unique to BetterHelp and is applicable to in-person therapy as well.
For example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena.
Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them.
Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that.
We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.
You should also be aware that Therapists may be obliged to disclose information to authorities to meet professional and legal responsibilities.
Specifically, some laws require mental health professionals to disclose information and/or take action for: (a) reported or suspected abuse; (b) serious suicidal potential; (c) threatened harm; and (d) court-ordered treatment.
You should speak with your Therapist if you have concerns about this.
Do you sell my data?
We aren't paid by anyone for any data.
However, in California, the laws define “sale” broadly to include the sharing of personal information in exchange for anything of value.
If you opt in to our use of Advertising cookies and web beacons, this use may be considered a “sale” of personal information under that specific California law.
For specific information on your data rights as a resident of California, see the additional notice for California residents.
Are you using my data for advertising?
In order to reach people who may be looking for mental health support, we advertise on some Third Party2 web properties such as Third Party websites and apps.
In order to minimize advertising costs related to this process and downstream costs to you, we strive to deliver ads that are relevant, interesting, and personal.
Therefore, if you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons, some Visitor Data, excluding activity when you're logged in and have started therapy, may be shared for advertising purposes.
As a result, you may see ads for our services on some Third Party websites.
If you use the App and have “Allowed” app to track using IOS or have opted into Advertising Cookies on Android, some data such as your mobile device identifier (IDFA and IDFV for iOS, and Android Advertising ID for Android) and data about how you use the App which is collected by our Service Provider Google (specifically GA4) will be used to make our Google advertising more effective.
This happens through an integration we have enabled between GA4 and Google Ads.
If you do not want to enable this, for Android users, you can navigate to “Sharing Settings” in the App and opt out of advertising.
For IOS users, you can “Ask App Not to Track” when you download the app or, at a later time, go to your device's privacy settings to see a list of apps that requested to track your activity (Go to Settings > Privacy & Security* > Tracking).
From there, you can tap to turn off or turn on permission to track for the BetterHelp app.
Even if you do opt in, we still do not engage in “retargeting” advertising.
Retargeting advertising is a type of advertising whereby advertisers leverage the fact that you viewed a page or took an action on their site to advertise to you again on third party properties in the hope that you will see the ad and return to their site.
To be clear, we don't share any data or information you share with your Therapist with any Third Party advertisers.
Even if you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons, we still don't share information with Third Party advertisers like Member names, phone numbers, clinician diagnosis, questionnaires answers, sessions data, journal entries, messages, worksheets, or any other type of private communication you have with your Therapist on the Platform.
As described further above at SECTION 2 Data Sharing, we may also partner with some Service Providers to assist in marketing campaigns.
Remember that in addition to needing a series of rigorous security standards (as further detailed here), Service Providers can only legally use data at our direction - no other person or company can authorize how they use it and they cannot disclose data that is individually identifiable to any other person or company, other than to us or the Service Providers' own subcontractors provided that they're bound to data Processing terms that are no less restrictive than the Service Provider's terms.
For additional information regarding Third Parties that BetterHelp may share data with, please reference our Third Party Partners Disclosure List.
SECTION 3Data Retention, Erasure, and ExportingHow long do you retain my data and how do I request data erasure?
BetterHelp is committed to ensuring that all applicable Member data is retained only for the amount of time required to provide relevant products and services and in accordance with relevant legal requirements.
Certain categories of data are retained for a period of time after you cancel your Membership or your Membership becomes inactive.
These categories of data are retained to allow for a seamless reactivation in the event you begin using our services again and allow Therapists to reference historical information.
Retaining this data is also needed to ensure our products and services function.
In addition to the data retention schedule outlined below, BetterHelp maintains a process for all Members (regardless of where they live) to receive and process, without undue delay, requests to erase or access their data.
The following sections describe both how long a Member can expect their data to be retained with respect to specific account information as well as how to request data erasure and access.
In this Policy, data erasure is defined as the permanent removal or obfuscation of identifiable data (See "What is this Privacy Policy") so that it is no longer accessible by anyone.
Retention PolicyBetterHelp’s data retention policies are based upon what data is being Processed1, whether or not the Member has participated in therapy, and if the Member proactively requested data erasure or if the erasure is triggered due to Platform inactivity.

BetterHelp Business Retention and ErasureBetterHelp Business: Retention PolicyWe automatically delete BetterHelp Business Data about an individual three years after either the end of their organization’s relationship with BetterHelp, or the initial collection, if no such relationship existed.
(e.
g.
, an individual provided information for a BetterHelp Business demo, but never purchased the product).
BetterHelp Business: Requesting Data Erasure…To manually request the deletion of your BetterHelp Business data before the timeframes described above, please select the "Update Email Preferences" link located in the footer of the BetterHelp Business webpage, as well as the banner at the bottom of any BetterHelp Business email we send.
On that linked webpage, please check the box next to "Delete my Data.
"Note: BetterHelp Business Data is not associated with BetterHelp Member Data.
As such, if we hold both BetterHelp Member Data and BetterHelp Business Data about you, then the retention schedules and processes outlined above apply only to the information we hold about you within those respective data categories.
For example, an Account Administrator who also uses BetterHelp as a Member would need to follow the process described in “Requesting Data Erasure…” to request the erasure of their Member data, and the process described in "BetterHelp Business: Requesting Data Erasure" to request the erasure of their BetterHelp Business Data.
SECTION 4Security and AnonymityHow do you keep my data secure?
We apply industry standards and strive to apply best practices to prevent any unauthorized access and disclosure.
Internet-based services carry inherent security risks, but our systems infrastructure, encryption technology, operation and processes are all designed, built, and maintained with your security and privacy in mind.
Our Platform is certified by HITRUST - one of the most recognized data security certification programs in the health industry.
BetterHelp has an experienced team of data security professionals whose job it is to make sure we use secure technology to protect your data.
We have an Information Security team who test internal security at BetterHelp to try and anticipate threat actors and act defensively to build processes and infrastructure to prevent incidents and attacks.
We have numerous robust security practices such as:All messages between a Member and their Therapist are secure and have 256-bit encryption.
Our servers are distributed across multiple Tier 3 AWS Data Centers for optimal security and protection.
Our browsing encryption system (SSL) follows modern best practices.
Our databases are encrypted and scrambled rendering them useless in the unlikely event that they are stolen or inappropriately retrieved.
We have robust monitoring and alerting systems and procedures in place that include both automated systems and humans.
For example, there are always security personnel active in our 24/7 rotation.
For your own security, keep the following in mind:Phishing: This is a type of online identity theft or account hacking.
We will never request your login information or credit card information in any non-secure or unsolicited communication.
You should always be diligent when you are asked to provide your account information and make sure it is in our secure system.
External links: Our Platform may contain links to an external website or service.
We do not control external websites, and do not have control over their privacy policies and terms of use.
The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization, or representation of our affiliation with that external party or of their privacy and security policies or practices.
Can I sign up for BetterHelp and remain anonymous?
When you sign up for an account on BetterHelp, we do not ask you for your full name.
You may pick any name or “nickname” which will identify you in the system.
You will need to provide an email address so that we can verify your account, and so we can communicate with you.
You can choose an email that does not include your name (including if you are coming to us from an employer, organization, or other business partner and do not want to use your organization’s email address), but you should be aware that in some jurisdictions emails may be considered “personal data,” “personally identifiable information,” or “sensitive personal data” in certain circumstances.
When you decide to start the therapy process, we’ll ask you for your contact information for emergency situations such as if your Therapist thinks that you or someone else is in immediate danger.
Your Therapist may request additional specific information about you as required by their license or other accreditation guidelines.
Even though we try to limit the kinds of information you must provide to us as discussed above, it is very difficult to be truly “anonymous” when you use any app or the internet.

Who can see the interactions I have with my Therapist?
You and your Therapist are able to see the messages you send, the worksheets you submit.
Your Therapist can also see the journal entries you submit if you opt in to sharing journal entries.
If you consent, a licensed Therapist who is employed as part of the BetterHelp Clinical Operations Team may review correspondence with your Therapist for quality assurance purposes.
For example, if you raise a concern about your Therapist, or if we have concerns about a specific Therapist’s clinical care.
In addition, our internal Trust and Safety or Legal teams may review correspondence for specific accounts if we have a reason to believe that there is a security, legal, or fraud issue occurring with that specific account.
Messages with your Therapist are not shared with any Third Party2, and your live sessions are not recorded.
We also do not share when you send a message, or have a session with your Therapist, with any Third Party.
How do you treat data from children?
We don’t knowingly collect or solicit any data or information from anyone under the age of thirteen (13) or knowingly allow such persons to become our users.

SECTION 7Defining key policy terms1ProcessIn this Policy, we refer generally to activities done with data as "Processing" or "Process.
" Examples of Processing include collecting, storing, and using data.
2Third PartyFor the purposes of this Policy, a Third Party means an entity that is not BetterHelp, not a Service Provider, not a Therapist or any other parties that are specifically called out in this Policy.
3Connect you with therapy servicesIn order for us to connect you with therapy services on our Platform, we need to be able to facilitate information sharing between you and your Therapist so that you can get the help you need from them.
We also Process data like your Therapist preferences, your state (if applicable), and your country to determine what Therapist to suggest to you based on applicable licensing or accreditation requirements.
4Facilitate tools for you and your TherapistOnce you start therapy, we need to process certain data to enable therapy tools within the Platform such as journal entries, setting goals and providing relevant worksheets.
These help facilitate a more effective therapeutic experience and outcome.
5Communicate with youFor example, we need to make sure that if you ask a question or have a concern about the Platform, we’re able to respond to you and provide an answer.
Additionally, if you represent an organizational customer, such as a business or nonprofit, then the BetterHelp Business team may contact you in your professional capacity to service your organization’s account, answer questions, and provide support.
6Monitor and improve therapy qualityFor example, we track if a live session occurred, was canceled, or if the Therapist did not show up, to ensure that timely services are being delivered to you.
We also track ratings, reviews, complaints, and other client feedback to ensure the quality of Therapists on our Platform.
If you consent, a licensed Therapist who is employed as part of the BetterHelp Clinical Operations Team may review correspondence with your Therapist for quality assurance purposes.
For example, if you raise a concern about your Therapist, or we have concerns about a specific Therapist’s clinical care.
In addition, our internal Trust and Safety or Legal teams may review correspondence for specific accounts if we have a reason to believe that there is a security, legal, or fraud issue occurring with that specific account.
7Personalize your web or app experienceFor example, if you identify as a Member of the LGBTQ+ community and would prefer a Therapist who has relevant expertise, experience, and training to provide therapy services for LGBTQ+ Members, we Process information to allow us to match you with an appropriate Therapist that can meet these needs.
Another example is if you state that you would like help with anxiety, we may recommend content and features that would be helpful to you, such as anxiety-related group sessions.
8Help us understand how you use our services, how we can improve our products and services to make them more effective and convenient, and offer you new featuresFor example, we may use some of your data to determine which products and features to roll out, which features are popular and require more investment or resources, or decide to remove features that are not providing value.
We may also Process data to know when you have already seen certain notifications on the Platform and do not need to be shown them again.
Another example of this is when we use your IP address to help conveniently auto-populate your state (if applicable) and country, or assist you with providing your address when completing information about your emergency contact.
We may also track regular usage of certain pages, buttons, or features on the Platform in order to allocate our research and development resources appropriately.
In addition, if you opt in to Analytics (previously “Performance cookies”), we may process some data to track site visits across our sister sites such as ReGain and Teen Counseling, and our BetterHelp Business and therapist acquisition web properties.
This is known as “first-party cross domain tracking”.
9Comply with lawsFor example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena.
In addition, Therapists are subject to certain legal requirements and professional obligations to have a full record and/or complete information of the care and services they provide you ("Clinical Health Record"), which must be retained for a certain amount of time following the conclusion of your care.
This is not unique to BetterHelp and is applicable to in-person therapy as well.
Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them.
Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that.
We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.
10Protect your safety and the safety of othersFor example, if we have reason to believe that you or any other person may be in immediate danger or your privacy has been infringed upon, we may use the information to investigate or reach out to you or the appropriate authorities if it is legally appropriate/permitted to do so.
11Send opportunities, promotions, news, updates and reminders about our services and your accountFor example, we might email you to offer you special promotions or discounts.
We might also email you to provide you with therapy related news or content that you might find interesting.
You can opt out of receiving texts or marketing communications at any time.
If you engage with us in a professional capacity on behalf of an organization, such as a BetterHelp Business Account Administrator, then we might email promotions, discounts, and therapy-related news and content we think might be relevant to your organization.
You can opt out of receiving texts or marketing communications at any time.

This Program is optional, and Therapists may opt-out at any time.
Additional information about the Profile Boost Program, and the self-serve opt-out feature, is available on the Expertise and Preferences page of your Therapist Dashboard once you sign-up.
The legal basis for processing the above data for Therapists on our Platform (or for the purposes of recruiting them) are legitimate interest, performance of a contract, and consent.
In addition to processing, we also share some data with Service Providers12 in order for us to operate the Platform and to perform necessary website and application functions.
Additionally, when you opt into sharing, we share certain data with Third Parties.
For more information please see the section: "What are the purposes for sharing my data?
"If you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons (previously "Targeting cookies") some Visitor Data, excluding activity when you're logged in and have started therapy, may be shared for advertising purposes.
To learn more, see section, "Are you using my data for advertising?
".
Do you Process location data?
We process your IP address to determine your rough location so that we can personalize the platform for you.
For example, we show you relevant information about our service that applies to visitors from your country.
We also utilize your rough location to improve your user experience when using our platform.
For example we auto populate your state (if applicable) and country when you are completing our onboarding questionnaire.
We do not request or process exact location information such as information provided by your phone via GPS.
We Process your address information when you provide it as part of your emergency contact information when you start therapy on the Platform.

Are you using my data for advertising?
Additional Privacy Notice for California ResidentsHow do we use Artificial Intelligence?
We use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) algorithms to support and develop features to provide you services and improve the quality of the services.
Our processing of data may include some automated and some human (or manual) methods of processing.
The automated processing typically includes features aimed at completing manual, repetitive tasks more efficiently.
For example, we may use AI features to detect security risks, synthesize information for customer service agents, and help therapists manage and document sessions more effectively.
We expect these improvements to ultimately improve our services and experiences for Members and Therapists.
To help ensure these tools remain fair and accurate, as well as protect the privacy of our Members and Therapists, we either thoroughly review a model or build it internally and, unless you agree otherwise, do not use any Therapy Data, such as sessions data, journal entries, messages, worksheets, or any other type of private communication you have with your Therapist in a session to train an AI or NLU model.
SECTION 2Data SharingWhat are the purposes for sharing my data?
Here's some more information about the purposes for which we share your data:Your data may be shared to comply with applicable laws.
For example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena.
This is not unique to BetterHelp and is applicable to in-person therapy as well.
Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them.
Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that.
We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.
Occasionally, your data may be handled by a select number of employees who are part of our parent company for support services.
These employees are under strict duties of confidentiality.
For example, a paralegal at our parent company may receive subpoenas or legal correspondence on behalf of Members or former Members and make sure they are provided to BetterHelp's Legal team to address.
We may share certain data with Service Providers12 that provide limited services that help us operate the Platform.
Examples include:Data hosting and storage providers: For example, cloud hosting providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Technology Service Providers: For example, we sometimes integrate tools into our Platform which give our Platform more functionality, like technology that helps us provide live audio, video and group meetings.
Customer Service Providers: For example, we use a tool that helps keep track of requests and questions from our Members, visitors and Therapists in a secure way.
Email management and communication Service Providers.
Email management and communication Service Providers: For example, we may use a tool that makes reaching out to you easier for us and more convenient for you.
Marketing and advertising Service Providers: For example, we may partner with an agency to run a marketing campaign or to help us better understand how to run our own campaigns to reach more people who may be interested in starting therapy.
Remember that Service Providers can only legally use data at our direction - no other person or company can authorize how they use it and they cannot disclose data that is individually identifiable to any other person or company, other than to us or the Service Providers' own subcontractors provided that they're bound to data Processing terms that are no less restrictive than the Service Provider's terms.
Billing and payment processing Service Providers: For example, we use Stripe to help process payments in a secure way.
Stripe also assists us in paying Therapists and issuing tax documents to them.
For this purpose, we may share email addresses of Therapists with Stripe and other data that is needed to pay Therapists such as a Therapist's name and tax ID.
Reporting and analytics Service Providers: For example, we might use a service to help us keep track of which pages and features are most used on our site.
Advisors and lawyers: To assist with business matters.
We may share some of your data with Service Providers to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and that of our users.
If you're a Therapist on our Platform, or being recruited to join us, in addition to the above, we may share certain data with Therapist recruiters in order to facilitate, monitor, and track the recruitment process.
If you are a Therapist on our Platform, we may also share certain data such as information you volunteer in or through the Platform including, but not limited to, your name, photograph, NPI (if applicable), information about your credentials, experience, specialties and qualifications with insurance payors or health plans for the purposes of contracting with them.
We may also share this information with vendors that accreditate/certify our therapist credentialing processes and otherwise help us streamline the credentialing process.
For Members who receive services in connection with an employer, organization, or other business partner, we may share group-level usage data, which cannot be directly connected to you, with your organization.
In the instance of Members who receive services through an Employee Assistance Program (“EAP”), your EAP will provide notice for any individual-level data which is shared with the EAP, if you are utilizing one and have provided them with consent for us to do so.
If you have any questions on how your data will be used by or shared with your EAP, please reach out to your EAP directly.
We may share some of your data in connection with an asset sale, merger or bankruptcy.
Note that if you make any information publicly available on the Platform, such as with a public post, anyone may see and use such information.
If you opt in to "Analytics (previously "Performance cookies")", we may use analytics cookies and other tracking technologies to share your data with trusted Service Providers that assist us to Process1 data for activities including but not limited to analyzing traffic sources, visits, and site interactions.
This analysis helps us to improve our products and services.
If you opt in to "Advertising (previously "Targeting cookies")" information regarding your activity on our websites, excluding activity when you're logged in and have started therapy, may be shared for advertising purposes.
For more information about your specific settings, see here.
To learn more, see section: "Are you using my data for advertising?
"How do you use my data to comply with the law?
When required by law, we cooperate with government agencies.
This is not unique to BetterHelp and is applicable to in-person therapy as well.
For example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena.
Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them.
Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that.
We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.
You should also be aware that Therapists may be obliged to disclose information to authorities to meet professional and legal responsibilities.
Specifically, some laws require mental health professionals to disclose information and/or take action for: (a) reported or suspected abuse; (b) serious suicidal potential; (c) threatened harm; and (d) court-ordered treatment.
You should speak with your Therapist if you have concerns about this.
Do you sell my data?
We aren't paid by anyone for any data.
However, in California, the laws define “sale” broadly to include the sharing of personal information in exchange for anything of value.
If you opt in to our use of Advertising cookies and web beacons, this use may be considered a “sale” of personal information under that specific California law.
For specific information on your data rights as a resident of California, see the additional notice for California residents.
Are you using my data for advertising?
In order to reach people who may be looking for mental health support, we advertise on some Third Party2 web properties such as Third Party websites and apps.
In order to minimize advertising costs related to this process and downstream costs to you, we strive to deliver ads that are relevant, interesting, and personal.
Therefore, if you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons, some Visitor Data, excluding activity when you're logged in and have started therapy, may be shared for advertising purposes.
As a result, you may see ads for our services on some Third Party websites.
If you use the App and have “Allowed” app to track using IOS or have opted into Advertising Cookies on Android, some data such as your mobile device identifier (IDFA and IDFV for iOS, and Android Advertising ID for Android) and data about how you use the App which is collected by our Service Provider Google (specifically GA4) will be used to make our Google advertising more effective.
This happens through an integration we have enabled between GA4 and Google Ads.
If you do not want to enable this, for Android users, you can navigate to “Sharing Settings” in the App and opt out of advertising.
For IOS users, you can “Ask App Not to Track” when you download the app or, at a later time, go to your device's privacy settings to see a list of apps that requested to track your activity (Go to Settings > Privacy & Security* > Tracking).
From there, you can tap to turn off or turn on permission to track for the BetterHelp app.
Even if you do opt in, we still do not engage in “retargeting” advertising.
Retargeting advertising is a type of advertising whereby advertisers leverage the fact that you viewed a page or took an action on their site to advertise to you again on third party properties in the hope that you will see the ad and return to their site.
To be clear, we don't share any data or information you share with your Therapist with any Third Party advertisers.
Even if you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons, we still don't share information with Third Party advertisers like Member names, phone numbers, clinician diagnosis, questionnaires answers, sessions data, journal entries, messages, worksheets, or any other type of private communication you have with your Therapist on the Platform.
As described further above at SECTION 2 Data Sharing, we may also partner with some Service Providers to assist in marketing campaigns.
Remember that in addition to needing a series of rigorous security standards (as further detailed here), Service Providers can only legally use data at our direction - no other person or company can authorize how they use it and they cannot disclose data that is individually identifiable to any other person or company, other than to us or the Service Providers' own subcontractors provided that they're bound to data Processing terms that are no less restrictive than the Service Provider's terms.
For additional information regarding Third Parties that BetterHelp may share data with, please reference our Third Party Partners Disclosure List.
SECTION 3Data Retention, Erasure, and ExportingHow long do you retain my data and how do I request data erasure?
BetterHelp is committed to ensuring that all applicable Member data is retained only for the amount of time required to provide relevant products and services and in accordance with relevant legal requirements.
Certain categories of data are retained for a period of time after you cancel your Membership or your Membership becomes inactive.
These categories of data are retained to allow for a seamless reactivation in the event you begin using our services again and allow Therapists to reference historical information.
Retaining this data is also needed to ensure our products and services function.
In addition to the data retention schedule outlined below, BetterHelp maintains a process for all Members (regardless of where they live) to receive and process, without undue delay, requests to erase or access their data.
The following sections describe both how long a Member can expect their data to be retained with respect to specific account information as well as how to request data erasure and access.
In this Policy, data erasure is defined as the permanent removal or obfuscation of identifiable data (See "What is this Privacy Policy") so that it is no longer accessible by anyone.
Retention PolicyBetterHelp’s data retention policies are based upon what data is being Processed1, whether or not the Member has participated in therapy, and if the Member proactively requested data erasure or if the erasure is triggered due to Platform inactivity.

In exceptional circumstances, we may charge a reasonable fee after discussing the fee with you.
If you reach out to either Member Success or DPO@betterhelp.
com, we have specific requirements that must be met in order for us to process your data erasure request.
Requirements:Only you or your authorized representative may make a request on your behalf.
You may also make a request on behalf of your minor child depending on the applicable laws.
You must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify your identity or status as an authorized representative.
You must provide details that allow us to understand, evaluate, and respond to your request.
In some circumstances, legal or regulatory requirements limit our ability to honor erasure requests.
As such, we may decline requests for erasure if the information is:Subject to a litigation hold or legal request to preserve it.
Necessary to comply with laws and regulations and to maintain business integrity.
Clinical Health Record (described above) falls under this exemption.
Additionally, compliance obligations require us to retain records documenting certain interactions you have with us related to your Membership.
As such, we cannot honor erasure requests for information contained in records of:Communications about complaints and erasure or access requests.
Disclosures of personal data to Third Parties.
If we don’t intend to comply with a request, then we will tell you why this is the case, and outline how we weighed your rights and freedoms against our legal obligations.

BetterHelp Business Retention and ErasureBetterHelp Business: Retention PolicyWe automatically delete BetterHelp Business Data about an individual three years after either the end of their organization’s relationship with BetterHelp, or the initial collection, if no such relationship existed.
(e.
g.
, an individual provided information for a BetterHelp Business demo, but never purchased the product).
BetterHelp Business: Requesting Data Erasure…To manually request the deletion of your BetterHelp Business data before the timeframes described above, please select the "Update Email Preferences" link located in the footer of the BetterHelp Business webpage, as well as the banner at the bottom of any BetterHelp Business email we send.
On that linked webpage, please check the box next to "Delete my Data.
"Note: BetterHelp Business Data is not associated with BetterHelp Member Data.
As such, if we hold both BetterHelp Member Data and BetterHelp Business Data about you, then the retention schedules and processes outlined above apply only to the information we hold about you within those respective data categories.
For example, an Account Administrator who also uses BetterHelp as a Member would need to follow the process described in “Requesting Data Erasure…” to request the erasure of their Member data, and the process described in "BetterHelp Business: Requesting Data Erasure" to request the erasure of their BetterHelp Business Data.
SECTION 4Security and AnonymityHow do you keep my data secure?
We apply industry standards and strive to apply best practices to prevent any unauthorized access and disclosure.
Internet-based services carry inherent security risks, but our systems infrastructure, encryption technology, operation and processes are all designed, built, and maintained with your security and privacy in mind.
Our Platform is certified by HITRUST - one of the most recognized data security certification programs in the health industry.
BetterHelp has an experienced team of data security professionals whose job it is to make sure we use secure technology to protect your data.
We have an Information Security team who test internal security at BetterHelp to try and anticipate threat actors and act defensively to build processes and infrastructure to prevent incidents and attacks.
We have numerous robust security practices such as:All messages between a Member and their Therapist are secure and have 256-bit encryption.
Our servers are distributed across multiple Tier 3 AWS Data Centers for optimal security and protection.
Our browsing encryption system (SSL) follows modern best practices.
Our databases are encrypted and scrambled rendering them useless in the unlikely event that they are stolen or inappropriately retrieved.
We have robust monitoring and alerting systems and procedures in place that include both automated systems and humans.
For example, there are always security personnel active in our 24/7 rotation.
For your own security, keep the following in mind:Phishing: This is a type of online identity theft or account hacking.
We will never request your login information or credit card information in any non-secure or unsolicited communication.
You should always be diligent when you are asked to provide your account information and make sure it is in our secure system.
External links: Our Platform may contain links to an external website or service.
We do not control external websites, and do not have control over their privacy policies and terms of use.
The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization, or representation of our affiliation with that external party or of their privacy and security policies or practices.
Can I sign up for BetterHelp and remain anonymous?
When you sign up for an account on BetterHelp, we do not ask you for your full name.
You may pick any name or “nickname” which will identify you in the system.
You will need to provide an email address so that we can verify your account, and so we can communicate with you.
You can choose an email that does not include your name (including if you are coming to us from an employer, organization, or other business partner and do not want to use your organization’s email address), but you should be aware that in some jurisdictions emails may be considered “personal data,” “personally identifiable information,” or “sensitive personal data” in certain circumstances.
When you decide to start the therapy process, we’ll ask you for your contact information for emergency situations such as if your Therapist thinks that you or someone else is in immediate danger.
Your Therapist may request additional specific information about you as required by their license or other accreditation guidelines.
Even though we try to limit the kinds of information you must provide to us as discussed above, it is very difficult to be truly “anonymous” when you use any app or the internet.

Your Therapist can also see the journal entries you submit if you opt in to sharing journal entries.
If you consent, a licensed Therapist who is employed as part of the BetterHelp Clinical Operations Team may review correspondence with your Therapist for quality assurance purposes.
For example, if you raise a concern about your Therapist, or if we have concerns about a specific Therapist’s clinical care.
In addition, our internal Trust and Safety or Legal teams may review correspondence for specific accounts if we have a reason to believe that there is a security, legal, or fraud issue occurring with that specific account.
Messages with your Therapist are not shared with any Third Party2, and your live sessions are not recorded.
We also do not share when you send a message, or have a session with your Therapist, with any Third Party.
How do you treat data from children?
We don’t knowingly collect or solicit any data or information from anyone under the age of thirteen (13) or knowingly allow such persons to become our users.

If you’re aware that we have collected personal information from a child under age thirteen (13), please let us know by contacting us, and we’ll delete that information.
SECTION 5Cookies and Web BeaconsWhat is a cookie or web beacon?
A “cookie“ is a small data file that is accessible within a folder on a computer, and it is used for record-keeping purposes.
Cookies are used to enhance performance of the Platform, personalize your experience and can be used for Third Party2 tracking (as described above).
For example, cookies may be used to help you quickly log into certain platforms and websites without having to enter your credentials every time.
A “web beacon“ or “pixel” is a tiny and sometimes invisible image or embedded code, placed on a web page or email that can report your visit or use to a Third Party (as described above).

SECTION 7Defining key policy terms1ProcessIn this Policy, we refer generally to activities done with data as "Processing" or "Process.
" Examples of Processing include collecting, storing, and using data.
2Third PartyFor the purposes of this Policy, a Third Party means an entity that is not BetterHelp, not a Service Provider, not a Therapist or any other parties that are specifically called out in this Policy.
3Connect you with therapy servicesIn order for us to connect you with therapy services on our Platform, we need to be able to facilitate information sharing between you and your Therapist so that you can get the help you need from them.
We also Process data like your Therapist preferences, your state (if applicable), and your country to determine what Therapist to suggest to you based on applicable licensing or accreditation requirements.
4Facilitate tools for you and your TherapistOnce you start therapy, we need to process certain data to enable therapy tools within the Platform such as journal entries, setting goals and providing relevant worksheets.
These help facilitate a more effective therapeutic experience and outcome.
5Communicate with youFor example, we need to make sure that if you ask a question or have a concern about the Platform, we’re able to respond to you and provide an answer.
Additionally, if you represent an organizational customer, such as a business or nonprofit, then the BetterHelp Business team may contact you in your professional capacity to service your organization’s account, answer questions, and provide support.
6Monitor and improve therapy qualityFor example, we track if a live session occurred, was canceled, or if the Therapist did not show up, to ensure that timely services are being delivered to you.
We also track ratings, reviews, complaints, and other client feedback to ensure the quality of Therapists on our Platform.
If you consent, a licensed Therapist who is employed as part of the BetterHelp Clinical Operations Team may review correspondence with your Therapist for quality assurance purposes.
For example, if you raise a concern about your Therapist, or we have concerns about a specific Therapist’s clinical care.
In addition, our internal Trust and Safety or Legal teams may review correspondence for specific accounts if we have a reason to believe that there is a security, legal, or fraud issue occurring with that specific account.
7Personalize your web or app experienceFor example, if you identify as a Member of the LGBTQ+ community and would prefer a Therapist who has relevant expertise, experience, and training to provide therapy services for LGBTQ+ Members, we Process information to allow us to match you with an appropriate Therapist that can meet these needs.
Another example is if you state that you would like help with anxiety, we may recommend content and features that would be helpful to you, such as anxiety-related group sessions.
8Help us understand how you use our services, how we can improve our products and services to make them more effective and convenient, and offer you new featuresFor example, we may use some of your data to determine which products and features to roll out, which features are popular and require more investment or resources, or decide to remove features that are not providing value.
We may also Process data to know when you have already seen certain notifications on the Platform and do not need to be shown them again.
Another example of this is when we use your IP address to help conveniently auto-populate your state (if applicable) and country, or assist you with providing your address when completing information about your emergency contact.
We may also track regular usage of certain pages, buttons, or features on the Platform in order to allocate our research and development resources appropriately.
In addition, if you opt in to Analytics (previously “Performance cookies”), we may process some data to track site visits across our sister sites such as ReGain and Teen Counseling, and our BetterHelp Business and therapist acquisition web properties.
This is known as “first-party cross domain tracking”.
9Comply with lawsFor example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena.
In addition, Therapists are subject to certain legal requirements and professional obligations to have a full record and/or complete information of the care and services they provide you ("Clinical Health Record"), which must be retained for a certain amount of time following the conclusion of your care.
This is not unique to BetterHelp and is applicable to in-person therapy as well.
Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them.
Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that.
We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.
10Protect your safety and the safety of othersFor example, if we have reason to believe that you or any other person may be in immediate danger or your privacy has been infringed upon, we may use the information to investigate or reach out to you or the appropriate authorities if it is legally appropriate/permitted to do so.
11Send opportunities, promotions, news, updates and reminders about our services and your accountFor example, we might email you to offer you special promotions or discounts.
We might also email you to provide you with therapy related news or content that you might find interesting.
You can opt out of receiving texts or marketing communications at any time.
If you engage with us in a professional capacity on behalf of an organization, such as a BetterHelp Business Account Administrator, then we might email promotions, discounts, and therapy-related news and content we think might be relevant to your organization.
You can opt out of receiving texts or marketing communications at any time.
12Service ProviderWe define a Service Provider as a person or company that we have a legal agreement with to Process data collected by us or on our behalf.
Data that is Processed on our behalf is required to be done only at our direction - no other person or company can authorize it.
Our Service Providers are not permitted to disclose data that is individually identifiable to any other person or company, other than to us or the Service Providers’ own subcontractors provided that they’re bound to data Processing terms that are no less restrictive than the Service Provider’s terms.
The data obtained by Service Providers from their relationship with us must only be used for performing the services specified in our agreement with them, or as reasonably necessary to perform one or more of the following:Comply with applicable law, regulation, or legal process;Detect, prevent or mitigate fraud or security vulnerabilities;Debug to identify and repair errors impairing existing intended functionalities; and/orConduct internal research for technological development and demonstration of our products or services, if such use is reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the purpose for which the data was shared.
13External IdentifierAn identifier issued by or belonging to an external entity that is not BetterHelp (such as a Service Provider or Third Party) such as a “click” identifier, a cookie identifier or device identifier.
Examples of External Identifiers are the Google Click ID, Google Advertising ID, IDFA, Meta Click ID, and the TikTok click ID.
14Internal IdentifierAn identifier issued by, belonging to or hosted on-premises by BetterHelp that is unique to a user.
Examples of Internal Identifiers are User ID’s (and hashed User ID’s) and internal identifiers issued to conduct internal first-party analytics.
15Monitor and protect the security of the PlatformFor example, we process certain data to make sure only you are able to access your account, and to place controls or challenges to prevent unauthorized access.
We may also process some of your data when issuing security patches and bug fixes in order to address security risks.
We may also process your data to track potential abuse on the platform, prevent and detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.

We use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) algorithms to support and develop features to provide you services and improve the quality of the services.
Our processing of data may include some automated and some human (or manual) methods of processing.
The automated processing typically includes features aimed at completing manual, repetitive tasks more efficiently.
For example, we may use AI features to detect security risks, synthesize information for customer service agents, and help therapists manage and document sessions more effectively.
We expect these improvements to ultimately improve our services and experiences for Members and Therapists.
To help ensure these tools remain fair and accurate, as well as protect the privacy of our Members and Therapists, we either thoroughly review a model or build it internally and, unless you agree otherwise, do not use any Therapy Data, such as sessions data, journal entries, messages, worksheets, or any other type of private communication you have with your Therapist in a session to train an AI or NLU model.
SECTION 2Data SharingWhat are the purposes for sharing my data?
Here's some more information about the purposes for which we share your data:Your data may be shared to comply with applicable laws.
For example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena.
This is not unique to BetterHelp and is applicable to in-person therapy as well.
Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them.
Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that.
We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.
Occasionally, your data may be handled by a select number of employees who are part of our parent company for support services.
These employees are under strict duties of confidentiality.
For example, a paralegal at our parent company may receive subpoenas or legal correspondence on behalf of Members or former Members and make sure they are provided to BetterHelp's Legal team to address.
We may share certain data with Service Providers12 that provide limited services that help us operate the Platform.
Examples include:Data hosting and storage providers: For example, cloud hosting providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Technology Service Providers: For example, we sometimes integrate tools into our Platform which give our Platform more functionality, like technology that helps us provide live audio, video and group meetings.
Customer Service Providers: For example, we use a tool that helps keep track of requests and questions from our Members, visitors and Therapists in a secure way.
Email management and communication Service Providers.
Email management and communication Service Providers: For example, we may use a tool that makes reaching out to you easier for us and more convenient for you.
Marketing and advertising Service Providers: For example, we may partner with an agency to run a marketing campaign or to help us better understand how to run our own campaigns to reach more people who may be interested in starting therapy.
Remember that Service Providers can only legally use data at our direction - no other person or company can authorize how they use it and they cannot disclose data that is individually identifiable to any other person or company, other than to us or the Service Providers' own subcontractors provided that they're bound to data Processing terms that are no less restrictive than the Service Provider's terms.
Billing and payment processing Service Providers: For example, we use Stripe to help process payments in a secure way.
Stripe also assists us in paying Therapists and issuing tax documents to them.
For this purpose, we may share email addresses of Therapists with Stripe and other data that is needed to pay Therapists such as a Therapist's name and tax ID.
Reporting and analytics Service Providers: For example, we might use a service to help us keep track of which pages and features are most used on our site.
Advisors and lawyers: To assist with business matters.
We may share some of your data with Service Providers to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and that of our users.
If you're a Therapist on our Platform, or being recruited to join us, in addition to the above, we may share certain data with Therapist recruiters in order to facilitate, monitor, and track the recruitment process.
If you are a Therapist on our Platform, we may also share certain data such as information you volunteer in or through the Platform including, but not limited to, your name, photograph, NPI (if applicable), information about your credentials, experience, specialties and qualifications with insurance payors or health plans for the purposes of contracting with them.
We may also share this information with vendors that accreditate/certify our therapist credentialing processes and otherwise help us streamline the credentialing process.
For Members who receive services in connection with an employer, organization, or other business partner, we may share group-level usage data, which cannot be directly connected to you, with your organization.
In the instance of Members who receive services through an Employee Assistance Program (“EAP”), your EAP will provide notice for any individual-level data which is shared with the EAP, if you are utilizing one and have provided them with consent for us to do so.
If you have any questions on how your data will be used by or shared with your EAP, please reach out to your EAP directly.
We may share some of your data in connection with an asset sale, merger or bankruptcy.
Note that if you make any information publicly available on the Platform, such as with a public post, anyone may see and use such information.
If you opt in to "Analytics (previously "Performance cookies")", we may use analytics cookies and other tracking technologies to share your data with trusted Service Providers that assist us to Process1 data for activities including but not limited to analyzing traffic sources, visits, and site interactions.
This analysis helps us to improve our products and services.
If you opt in to "Advertising (previously "Targeting cookies")" information regarding your activity on our websites, excluding activity when you're logged in and have started therapy, may be shared for advertising purposes.
For more information about your specific settings, see here.
To learn more, see section: "Are you using my data for advertising?
"How do you use my data to comply with the law?
When required by law, we cooperate with government agencies.
This is not unique to BetterHelp and is applicable to in-person therapy as well.
For example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena.
Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them.
Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that.
We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.
You should also be aware that Therapists may be obliged to disclose information to authorities to meet professional and legal responsibilities.
Specifically, some laws require mental health professionals to disclose information and/or take action for: (a) reported or suspected abuse; (b) serious suicidal potential; (c) threatened harm; and (d) court-ordered treatment.
You should speak with your Therapist if you have concerns about this.
Do you sell my data?
We aren't paid by anyone for any data.
However, in California, the laws define “sale” broadly to include the sharing of personal information in exchange for anything of value.
If you opt in to our use of Advertising cookies and web beacons, this use may be considered a “sale” of personal information under that specific California law.
For specific information on your data rights as a resident of California, see the additional notice for California residents.
Are you using my data for advertising?
In order to reach people who may be looking for mental health support, we advertise on some Third Party2 web properties such as Third Party websites and apps.
In order to minimize advertising costs related to this process and downstream costs to you, we strive to deliver ads that are relevant, interesting, and personal.
Therefore, if you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons, some Visitor Data, excluding activity when you're logged in and have started therapy, may be shared for advertising purposes.
As a result, you may see ads for our services on some Third Party websites.
If you use the App and have “Allowed” app to track using IOS or have opted into Advertising Cookies on Android, some data such as your mobile device identifier (IDFA and IDFV for iOS, and Android Advertising ID for Android) and data about how you use the App which is collected by our Service Provider Google (specifically GA4) will be used to make our Google advertising more effective.
This happens through an integration we have enabled between GA4 and Google Ads.
If you do not want to enable this, for Android users, you can navigate to “Sharing Settings” in the App and opt out of advertising.
For IOS users, you can “Ask App Not to Track” when you download the app or, at a later time, go to your device's privacy settings to see a list of apps that requested to track your activity (Go to Settings > Privacy & Security* > Tracking).
From there, you can tap to turn off or turn on permission to track for the BetterHelp app.
Even if you do opt in, we still do not engage in “retargeting” advertising.
Retargeting advertising is a type of advertising whereby advertisers leverage the fact that you viewed a page or took an action on their site to advertise to you again on third party properties in the hope that you will see the ad and return to their site.
To be clear, we don't share any data or information you share with your Therapist with any Third Party advertisers.
Even if you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons, we still don't share information with Third Party advertisers like Member names, phone numbers, clinician diagnosis, questionnaires answers, sessions data, journal entries, messages, worksheets, or any other type of private communication you have with your Therapist on the Platform.
As described further above at SECTION 2 Data Sharing, we may also partner with some Service Providers to assist in marketing campaigns.
Remember that in addition to needing a series of rigorous security standards (as further detailed here), Service Providers can only legally use data at our direction - no other person or company can authorize how they use it and they cannot disclose data that is individually identifiable to any other person or company, other than to us or the Service Providers' own subcontractors provided that they're bound to data Processing terms that are no less restrictive than the Service Provider's terms.
For additional information regarding Third Parties that BetterHelp may share data with, please reference our Third Party Partners Disclosure List.
SECTION 3Data Retention, Erasure, and ExportingHow long do you retain my data and how do I request data erasure?
BetterHelp is committed to ensuring that all applicable Member data is retained only for the amount of time required to provide relevant products and services and in accordance with relevant legal requirements.
Certain categories of data are retained for a period of time after you cancel your Membership or your Membership becomes inactive.
These categories of data are retained to allow for a seamless reactivation in the event you begin using our services again and allow Therapists to reference historical information.
Retaining this data is also needed to ensure our products and services function.
In addition to the data retention schedule outlined below, BetterHelp maintains a process for all Members (regardless of where they live) to receive and process, without undue delay, requests to erase or access their data.
The following sections describe both how long a Member can expect their data to be retained with respect to specific account information as well as how to request data erasure and access.
In this Policy, data erasure is defined as the permanent removal or obfuscation of identifiable data (See "What is this Privacy Policy") so that it is no longer accessible by anyone.
Retention PolicyBetterHelp’s data retention policies are based upon what data is being Processed1, whether or not the Member has participated in therapy, and if the Member proactively requested data erasure or if the erasure is triggered due to Platform inactivity.

BetterHelp Business Retention and ErasureBetterHelp Business: Retention PolicyWe automatically delete BetterHelp Business Data about an individual three years after either the end of their organization’s relationship with BetterHelp, or the initial collection, if no such relationship existed.
(e.
g.
, an individual provided information for a BetterHelp Business demo, but never purchased the product).
BetterHelp Business: Requesting Data Erasure…To manually request the deletion of your BetterHelp Business data before the timeframes described above, please select the "Update Email Preferences" link located in the footer of the BetterHelp Business webpage, as well as the banner at the bottom of any BetterHelp Business email we send.
On that linked webpage, please check the box next to "Delete my Data.
"Note: BetterHelp Business Data is not associated with BetterHelp Member Data.
As such, if we hold both BetterHelp Member Data and BetterHelp Business Data about you, then the retention schedules and processes outlined above apply only to the information we hold about you within those respective data categories.
For example, an Account Administrator who also uses BetterHelp as a Member would need to follow the process described in “Requesting Data Erasure…” to request the erasure of their Member data, and the process described in "BetterHelp Business: Requesting Data Erasure" to request the erasure of their BetterHelp Business Data.
SECTION 4Security and AnonymityHow do you keep my data secure?
We apply industry standards and strive to apply best practices to prevent any unauthorized access and disclosure.
Internet-based services carry inherent security risks, but our systems infrastructure, encryption technology, operation and processes are all designed, built, and maintained with your security and privacy in mind.
Our Platform is certified by HITRUST - one of the most recognized data security certification programs in the health industry.
BetterHelp has an experienced team of data security professionals whose job it is to make sure we use secure technology to protect your data.
We have an Information Security team who test internal security at BetterHelp to try and anticipate threat actors and act defensively to build processes and infrastructure to prevent incidents and attacks.
We have numerous robust security practices such as:All messages between a Member and their Therapist are secure and have 256-bit encryption.
Our servers are distributed across multiple Tier 3 AWS Data Centers for optimal security and protection.
Our browsing encryption system (SSL) follows modern best practices.
Our databases are encrypted and scrambled rendering them useless in the unlikely event that they are stolen or inappropriately retrieved.
We have robust monitoring and alerting systems and procedures in place that include both automated systems and humans.
For example, there are always security personnel active in our 24/7 rotation.
For your own security, keep the following in mind:Phishing: This is a type of online identity theft or account hacking.
We will never request your login information or credit card information in any non-secure or unsolicited communication.
You should always be diligent when you are asked to provide your account information and make sure it is in our secure system.
External links: Our Platform may contain links to an external website or service.
We do not control external websites, and do not have control over their privacy policies and terms of use.
The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization, or representation of our affiliation with that external party or of their privacy and security policies or practices.
Can I sign up for BetterHelp and remain anonymous?
When you sign up for an account on BetterHelp, we do not ask you for your full name.
You may pick any name or “nickname” which will identify you in the system.
You will need to provide an email address so that we can verify your account, and so we can communicate with you.
You can choose an email that does not include your name (including if you are coming to us from an employer, organization, or other business partner and do not want to use your organization’s email address), but you should be aware that in some jurisdictions emails may be considered “personal data,” “personally identifiable information,” or “sensitive personal data” in certain circumstances.
When you decide to start the therapy process, we’ll ask you for your contact information for emergency situations such as if your Therapist thinks that you or someone else is in immediate danger.
Your Therapist may request additional specific information about you as required by their license or other accreditation guidelines.
Even though we try to limit the kinds of information you must provide to us as discussed above, it is very difficult to be truly “anonymous” when you use any app or the internet.

Your Therapist can also see the journal entries you submit if you opt in to sharing journal entries.
If you consent, a licensed Therapist who is employed as part of the BetterHelp Clinical Operations Team may review correspondence with your Therapist for quality assurance purposes.
For example, if you raise a concern about your Therapist, or if we have concerns about a specific Therapist’s clinical care.
In addition, our internal Trust and Safety or Legal teams may review correspondence for specific accounts if we have a reason to believe that there is a security, legal, or fraud issue occurring with that specific account.
Messages with your Therapist are not shared with any Third Party2, and your live sessions are not recorded.
We also do not share when you send a message, or have a session with your Therapist, with any Third Party.

SECTION 5Cookies and Web BeaconsWhat is a cookie or web beacon?
A “cookie“ is a small data file that is accessible within a folder on a computer, and it is used for record-keeping purposes.

For example, cookies may be used to help you quickly log into certain platforms and websites without having to enter your credentials every time.
A “web beacon“ or “pixel” is a tiny and sometimes invisible image or embedded code, placed on a web page or email that can report your visit or use to a Third Party (as described above).

SECTION 7Defining key policy terms1ProcessIn this Policy, we refer generally to activities done with data as "Processing" or "Process.
" Examples of Processing include collecting, storing, and using data.
2Third PartyFor the purposes of this Policy, a Third Party means an entity that is not BetterHelp, not a Service Provider, not a Therapist or any other parties that are specifically called out in this Policy.
3Connect you with therapy servicesIn order for us to connect you with therapy services on our Platform, we need to be able to facilitate information sharing between you and your Therapist so that you can get the help you need from them.
We also Process data like your Therapist preferences, your state (if applicable), and your country to determine what Therapist to suggest to you based on applicable licensing or accreditation requirements.
4Facilitate tools for you and your TherapistOnce you start therapy, we need to process certain data to enable therapy tools within the Platform such as journal entries, setting goals and providing relevant worksheets.
These help facilitate a more effective therapeutic experience and outcome.
5Communicate with youFor example, we need to make sure that if you ask a question or have a concern about the Platform, we’re able to respond to you and provide an answer.
Additionally, if you represent an organizational customer, such as a business or nonprofit, then the BetterHelp Business team may contact you in your professional capacity to service your organization’s account, answer questions, and provide support.
6Monitor and improve therapy qualityFor example, we track if a live session occurred, was canceled, or if the Therapist did not show up, to ensure that timely services are being delivered to you.
We also track ratings, reviews, complaints, and other client feedback to ensure the quality of Therapists on our Platform.
If you consent, a licensed Therapist who is employed as part of the BetterHelp Clinical Operations Team may review correspondence with your Therapist for quality assurance purposes.
For example, if you raise a concern about your Therapist, or we have concerns about a specific Therapist’s clinical care.
In addition, our internal Trust and Safety or Legal teams may review correspondence for specific accounts if we have a reason to believe that there is a security, legal, or fraud issue occurring with that specific account.
7Personalize your web or app experienceFor example, if you identify as a Member of the LGBTQ+ community and would prefer a Therapist who has relevant expertise, experience, and training to provide therapy services for LGBTQ+ Members, we Process information to allow us to match you with an appropriate Therapist that can meet these needs.
Another example is if you state that you would like help with anxiety, we may recommend content and features that would be helpful to you, such as anxiety-related group sessions.
8Help us understand how you use our services, how we can improve our products and services to make them more effective and convenient, and offer you new featuresFor example, we may use some of your data to determine which products and features to roll out, which features are popular and require more investment or resources, or decide to remove features that are not providing value.
We may also Process data to know when you have already seen certain notifications on the Platform and do not need to be shown them again.
Another example of this is when we use your IP address to help conveniently auto-populate your state (if applicable) and country, or assist you with providing your address when completing information about your emergency contact.
We may also track regular usage of certain pages, buttons, or features on the Platform in order to allocate our research and development resources appropriately.
In addition, if you opt in to Analytics (previously “Performance cookies”), we may process some data to track site visits across our sister sites such as ReGain and Teen Counseling, and our BetterHelp Business and therapist acquisition web properties.
This is known as “first-party cross domain tracking”.
9Comply with lawsFor example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena.
In addition, Therapists are subject to certain legal requirements and professional obligations to have a full record and/or complete information of the care and services they provide you ("Clinical Health Record"), which must be retained for a certain amount of time following the conclusion of your care.
This is not unique to BetterHelp and is applicable to in-person therapy as well.
Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them.
Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that.
We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.
10Protect your safety and the safety of othersFor example, if we have reason to believe that you or any other person may be in immediate danger or your privacy has been infringed upon, we may use the information to investigate or reach out to you or the appropriate authorities if it is legally appropriate/permitted to do so.
11Send opportunities, promotions, news, updates and reminders about our services and your accountFor example, we might email you to offer you special promotions or discounts.
We might also email you to provide you with therapy related news or content that you might find interesting.
You can opt out of receiving texts or marketing communications at any time.
If you engage with us in a professional capacity on behalf of an organization, such as a BetterHelp Business Account Administrator, then we might email promotions, discounts, and therapy-related news and content we think might be relevant to your organization.
You can opt out of receiving texts or marketing communications at any time.
12Service ProviderWe define a Service Provider as a person or company that we have a legal agreement with to Process data collected by us or on our behalf.
Data that is Processed on our behalf is required to be done only at our direction - no other person or company can authorize it.
Our Service Providers are not permitted to disclose data that is individually identifiable to any other person or company, other than to us or the Service Providers’ own subcontractors provided that they’re bound to data Processing terms that are no less restrictive than the Service Provider’s terms.
The data obtained by Service Providers from their relationship with us must only be used for performing the services specified in our agreement with them, or as reasonably necessary to perform one or more of the following:Comply with applicable law, regulation, or legal process;Detect, prevent or mitigate fraud or security vulnerabilities;Debug to identify and repair errors impairing existing intended functionalities; and/orConduct internal research for technological development and demonstration of our products or services, if such use is reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the purpose for which the data was shared.
13External IdentifierAn identifier issued by or belonging to an external entity that is not BetterHelp (such as a Service Provider or Third Party) such as a “click” identifier, a cookie identifier or device identifier.
Examples of External Identifiers are the Google Click ID, Google Advertising ID, IDFA, Meta Click ID, and the TikTok click ID.
14Internal IdentifierAn identifier issued by, belonging to or hosted on-premises by BetterHelp that is unique to a user.
Examples of Internal Identifiers are User ID’s (and hashed User ID’s) and internal identifiers issued to conduct internal first-party analytics.
15Monitor and protect the security of the PlatformFor example, we process certain data to make sure only you are able to access your account, and to place controls or challenges to prevent unauthorized access.
We may also process some of your data when issuing security patches and bug fixes in order to address security risks.
We may also process your data to track potential abuse on the platform, prevent and detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.

Do you Process location data?
We process your IP address to determine your rough location so that we can personalize the platform for you.
For example, we show you relevant information about our service that applies to visitors from your country.
We also utilize your rough location to improve your user experience when using our platform.
For example we auto populate your state (if applicable) and country when you are completing our onboarding questionnaire.
We do not request or process exact location information such as information provided by your phone via GPS.
We Process your address information when you provide it as part of your emergency contact information when you start therapy on the Platform.

Additional Privacy Notice for California ResidentsHow do we use Artificial Intelligence?
We use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) algorithms to support and develop features to provide you services and improve the quality of the services.
Our processing of data may include some automated and some human (or manual) methods of processing.
The automated processing typically includes features aimed at completing manual, repetitive tasks more efficiently.
For example, we may use AI features to detect security risks, synthesize information for customer service agents, and help therapists manage and document sessions more effectively.
We expect these improvements to ultimately improve our services and experiences for Members and Therapists.
To help ensure these tools remain fair and accurate, as well as protect the privacy of our Members and Therapists, we either thoroughly review a model or build it internally and, unless you agree otherwise, do not use any Therapy Data, such as sessions data, journal entries, messages, worksheets, or any other type of private communication you have with your Therapist in a session to train an AI or NLU model.
SECTION 2Data SharingWhat are the purposes for sharing my data?
Here's some more information about the purposes for which we share your data:Your data may be shared to comply with applicable laws.
For example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena.
This is not unique to BetterHelp and is applicable to in-person therapy as well.
Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them.
Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that.
We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.
Occasionally, your data may be handled by a select number of employees who are part of our parent company for support services.
These employees are under strict duties of confidentiality.
For example, a paralegal at our parent company may receive subpoenas or legal correspondence on behalf of Members or former Members and make sure they are provided to BetterHelp's Legal team to address.
We may share certain data with Service Providers12 that provide limited services that help us operate the Platform.
Examples include:Data hosting and storage providers: For example, cloud hosting providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Technology Service Providers: For example, we sometimes integrate tools into our Platform which give our Platform more functionality, like technology that helps us provide live audio, video and group meetings.
Customer Service Providers: For example, we use a tool that helps keep track of requests and questions from our Members, visitors and Therapists in a secure way.
Email management and communication Service Providers.
Email management and communication Service Providers: For example, we may use a tool that makes reaching out to you easier for us and more convenient for you.
Marketing and advertising Service Providers: For example, we may partner with an agency to run a marketing campaign or to help us better understand how to run our own campaigns to reach more people who may be interested in starting therapy.
Remember that Service Providers can only legally use data at our direction - no other person or company can authorize how they use it and they cannot disclose data that is individually identifiable to any other person or company, other than to us or the Service Providers' own subcontractors provided that they're bound to data Processing terms that are no less restrictive than the Service Provider's terms.
Billing and payment processing Service Providers: For example, we use Stripe to help process payments in a secure way.
Stripe also assists us in paying Therapists and issuing tax documents to them.
For this purpose, we may share email addresses of Therapists with Stripe and other data that is needed to pay Therapists such as a Therapist's name and tax ID.
Reporting and analytics Service Providers: For example, we might use a service to help us keep track of which pages and features are most used on our site.
Advisors and lawyers: To assist with business matters.
We may share some of your data with Service Providers to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and that of our users.
If you're a Therapist on our Platform, or being recruited to join us, in addition to the above, we may share certain data with Therapist recruiters in order to facilitate, monitor, and track the recruitment process.
If you are a Therapist on our Platform, we may also share certain data such as information you volunteer in or through the Platform including, but not limited to, your name, photograph, NPI (if applicable), information about your credentials, experience, specialties and qualifications with insurance payors or health plans for the purposes of contracting with them.
We may also share this information with vendors that accreditate/certify our therapist credentialing processes and otherwise help us streamline the credentialing process.
For Members who receive services in connection with an employer, organization, or other business partner, we may share group-level usage data, which cannot be directly connected to you, with your organization.
In the instance of Members who receive services through an Employee Assistance Program (“EAP”), your EAP will provide notice for any individual-level data which is shared with the EAP, if you are utilizing one and have provided them with consent for us to do so.
If you have any questions on how your data will be used by or shared with your EAP, please reach out to your EAP directly.
We may share some of your data in connection with an asset sale, merger or bankruptcy.
Note that if you make any information publicly available on the Platform, such as with a public post, anyone may see and use such information.
If you opt in to "Analytics (previously "Performance cookies")", we may use analytics cookies and other tracking technologies to share your data with trusted Service Providers that assist us to Process1 data for activities including but not limited to analyzing traffic sources, visits, and site interactions.
This analysis helps us to improve our products and services.
If you opt in to "Advertising (previously "Targeting cookies")" information regarding your activity on our websites, excluding activity when you're logged in and have started therapy, may be shared for advertising purposes.
For more information about your specific settings, see here.
To learn more, see section: "Are you using my data for advertising?
"How do you use my data to comply with the law?
When required by law, we cooperate with government agencies.
This is not unique to BetterHelp and is applicable to in-person therapy as well.
For example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena.
Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them.
Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that.
We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.
You should also be aware that Therapists may be obliged to disclose information to authorities to meet professional and legal responsibilities.
Specifically, some laws require mental health professionals to disclose information and/or take action for: (a) reported or suspected abuse; (b) serious suicidal potential; (c) threatened harm; and (d) court-ordered treatment.
You should speak with your Therapist if you have concerns about this.
Do you sell my data?
We aren't paid by anyone for any data.
However, in California, the laws define “sale” broadly to include the sharing of personal information in exchange for anything of value.
If you opt in to our use of Advertising cookies and web beacons, this use may be considered a “sale” of personal information under that specific California law.
For specific information on your data rights as a resident of California, see the additional notice for California residents.
Are you using my data for advertising?
In order to reach people who may be looking for mental health support, we advertise on some Third Party2 web properties such as Third Party websites and apps.
In order to minimize advertising costs related to this process and downstream costs to you, we strive to deliver ads that are relevant, interesting, and personal.
Therefore, if you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons, some Visitor Data, excluding activity when you're logged in and have started therapy, may be shared for advertising purposes.
As a result, you may see ads for our services on some Third Party websites.
If you use the App and have “Allowed” app to track using IOS or have opted into Advertising Cookies on Android, some data such as your mobile device identifier (IDFA and IDFV for iOS, and Android Advertising ID for Android) and data about how you use the App which is collected by our Service Provider Google (specifically GA4) will be used to make our Google advertising more effective.
This happens through an integration we have enabled between GA4 and Google Ads.
If you do not want to enable this, for Android users, you can navigate to “Sharing Settings” in the App and opt out of advertising.
For IOS users, you can “Ask App Not to Track” when you download the app or, at a later time, go to your device's privacy settings to see a list of apps that requested to track your activity (Go to Settings > Privacy & Security* > Tracking).
From there, you can tap to turn off or turn on permission to track for the BetterHelp app.
Even if you do opt in, we still do not engage in “retargeting” advertising.
Retargeting advertising is a type of advertising whereby advertisers leverage the fact that you viewed a page or took an action on their site to advertise to you again on third party properties in the hope that you will see the ad and return to their site.
To be clear, we don't share any data or information you share with your Therapist with any Third Party advertisers.
Even if you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons, we still don't share information with Third Party advertisers like Member names, phone numbers, clinician diagnosis, questionnaires answers, sessions data, journal entries, messages, worksheets, or any other type of private communication you have with your Therapist on the Platform.
As described further above at SECTION 2 Data Sharing, we may also partner with some Service Providers to assist in marketing campaigns.
Remember that in addition to needing a series of rigorous security standards (as further detailed here), Service Providers can only legally use data at our direction - no other person or company can authorize how they use it and they cannot disclose data that is individually identifiable to any other person or company, other than to us or the Service Providers' own subcontractors provided that they're bound to data Processing terms that are no less restrictive than the Service Provider's terms.
For additional information regarding Third Parties that BetterHelp may share data with, please reference our Third Party Partners Disclosure List.
SECTION 3Data Retention, Erasure, and ExportingHow long do you retain my data and how do I request data erasure?
BetterHelp is committed to ensuring that all applicable Member data is retained only for the amount of time required to provide relevant products and services and in accordance with relevant legal requirements.
Certain categories of data are retained for a period of time after you cancel your Membership or your Membership becomes inactive.
These categories of data are retained to allow for a seamless reactivation in the event you begin using our services again and allow Therapists to reference historical information.
Retaining this data is also needed to ensure our products and services function.
In addition to the data retention schedule outlined below, BetterHelp maintains a process for all Members (regardless of where they live) to receive and process, without undue delay, requests to erase or access their data.
The following sections describe both how long a Member can expect their data to be retained with respect to specific account information as well as how to request data erasure and access.
In this Policy, data erasure is defined as the permanent removal or obfuscation of identifiable data (See "What is this Privacy Policy") so that it is no longer accessible by anyone.

BetterHelp Business Retention and ErasureBetterHelp Business: Retention PolicyWe automatically delete BetterHelp Business Data about an individual three years after either the end of their organization’s relationship with BetterHelp, or the initial collection, if no such relationship existed.
(e.
g.
, an individual provided information for a BetterHelp Business demo, but never purchased the product).
BetterHelp Business: Requesting Data Erasure…To manually request the deletion of your BetterHelp Business data before the timeframes described above, please select the "Update Email Preferences" link located in the footer of the BetterHelp Business webpage, as well as the banner at the bottom of any BetterHelp Business email we send.
On that linked webpage, please check the box next to "Delete my Data.
"Note: BetterHelp Business Data is not associated with BetterHelp Member Data.
As such, if we hold both BetterHelp Member Data and BetterHelp Business Data about you, then the retention schedules and processes outlined above apply only to the information we hold about you within those respective data categories.
For example, an Account Administrator who also uses BetterHelp as a Member would need to follow the process described in “Requesting Data Erasure…” to request the erasure of their Member data, and the process described in "BetterHelp Business: Requesting Data Erasure" to request the erasure of their BetterHelp Business Data.
SECTION 4Security and AnonymityHow do you keep my data secure?
We apply industry standards and strive to apply best practices to prevent any unauthorized access and disclosure.
Internet-based services carry inherent security risks, but our systems infrastructure, encryption technology, operation and processes are all designed, built, and maintained with your security and privacy in mind.
Our Platform is certified by HITRUST - one of the most recognized data security certification programs in the health industry.
BetterHelp has an experienced team of data security professionals whose job it is to make sure we use secure technology to protect your data.
We have an Information Security team who test internal security at BetterHelp to try and anticipate threat actors and act defensively to build processes and infrastructure to prevent incidents and attacks.
We have numerous robust security practices such as:All messages between a Member and their Therapist are secure and have 256-bit encryption.
Our servers are distributed across multiple Tier 3 AWS Data Centers for optimal security and protection.
Our browsing encryption system (SSL) follows modern best practices.
Our databases are encrypted and scrambled rendering them useless in the unlikely event that they are stolen or inappropriately retrieved.
We have robust monitoring and alerting systems and procedures in place that include both automated systems and humans.
For example, there are always security personnel active in our 24/7 rotation.
For your own security, keep the following in mind:Phishing: This is a type of online identity theft or account hacking.
We will never request your login information or credit card information in any non-secure or unsolicited communication.
You should always be diligent when you are asked to provide your account information and make sure it is in our secure system.
External links: Our Platform may contain links to an external website or service.
We do not control external websites, and do not have control over their privacy policies and terms of use.
The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization, or representation of our affiliation with that external party or of their privacy and security policies or practices.
Can I sign up for BetterHelp and remain anonymous?
When you sign up for an account on BetterHelp, we do not ask you for your full name.
You may pick any name or “nickname” which will identify you in the system.
You will need to provide an email address so that we can verify your account, and so we can communicate with you.
You can choose an email that does not include your name (including if you are coming to us from an employer, organization, or other business partner and do not want to use your organization’s email address), but you should be aware that in some jurisdictions emails may be considered “personal data,” “personally identifiable information,” or “sensitive personal data” in certain circumstances.
When you decide to start the therapy process, we’ll ask you for your contact information for emergency situations such as if your Therapist thinks that you or someone else is in immediate danger.
Your Therapist may request additional specific information about you as required by their license or other accreditation guidelines.
Even though we try to limit the kinds of information you must provide to us as discussed above, it is very difficult to be truly “anonymous” when you use any app or the internet.

Your Therapist can also see the journal entries you submit if you opt in to sharing journal entries.
If you consent, a licensed Therapist who is employed as part of the BetterHelp Clinical Operations Team may review correspondence with your Therapist for quality assurance purposes.
For example, if you raise a concern about your Therapist, or if we have concerns about a specific Therapist’s clinical care.
In addition, our internal Trust and Safety or Legal teams may review correspondence for specific accounts if we have a reason to believe that there is a security, legal, or fraud issue occurring with that specific account.
Messages with your Therapist are not shared with any Third Party2, and your live sessions are not recorded.
We also do not share when you send a message, or have a session with your Therapist, with any Third Party.

SECTION 7Defining key policy terms1ProcessIn this Policy, we refer generally to activities done with data as "Processing" or "Process.
" Examples of Processing include collecting, storing, and using data.
2Third PartyFor the purposes of this Policy, a Third Party means an entity that is not BetterHelp, not a Service Provider, not a Therapist or any other parties that are specifically called out in this Policy.
3Connect you with therapy servicesIn order for us to connect you with therapy services on our Platform, we need to be able to facilitate information sharing between you and your Therapist so that you can get the help you need from them.
We also Process data like your Therapist preferences, your state (if applicable), and your country to determine what Therapist to suggest to you based on applicable licensing or accreditation requirements.
4Facilitate tools for you and your TherapistOnce you start therapy, we need to process certain data to enable therapy tools within the Platform such as journal entries, setting goals and providing relevant worksheets.
These help facilitate a more effective therapeutic experience and outcome.
5Communicate with youFor example, we need to make sure that if you ask a question or have a concern about the Platform, we’re able to respond to you and provide an answer.
Additionally, if you represent an organizational customer, such as a business or nonprofit, then the BetterHelp Business team may contact you in your professional capacity to service your organization’s account, answer questions, and provide support.
6Monitor and improve therapy qualityFor example, we track if a live session occurred, was canceled, or if the Therapist did not show up, to ensure that timely services are being delivered to you.
We also track ratings, reviews, complaints, and other client feedback to ensure the quality of Therapists on our Platform.
If you consent, a licensed Therapist who is employed as part of the BetterHelp Clinical Operations Team may review correspondence with your Therapist for quality assurance purposes.
For example, if you raise a concern about your Therapist, or we have concerns about a specific Therapist’s clinical care.
In addition, our internal Trust and Safety or Legal teams may review correspondence for specific accounts if we have a reason to believe that there is a security, legal, or fraud issue occurring with that specific account.
7Personalize your web or app experienceFor example, if you identify as a Member of the LGBTQ+ community and would prefer a Therapist who has relevant expertise, experience, and training to provide therapy services for LGBTQ+ Members, we Process information to allow us to match you with an appropriate Therapist that can meet these needs.
Another example is if you state that you would like help with anxiety, we may recommend content and features that would be helpful to you, such as anxiety-related group sessions.
8Help us understand how you use our services, how we can improve our products and services to make them more effective and convenient, and offer you new featuresFor example, we may use some of your data to determine which products and features to roll out, which features are popular and require more investment or resources, or decide to remove features that are not providing value.
We may also Process data to know when you have already seen certain notifications on the Platform and do not need to be shown them again.
Another example of this is when we use your IP address to help conveniently auto-populate your state (if applicable) and country, or assist you with providing your address when completing information about your emergency contact.
We may also track regular usage of certain pages, buttons, or features on the Platform in order to allocate our research and development resources appropriately.
In addition, if you opt in to Analytics (previously “Performance cookies”), we may process some data to track site visits across our sister sites such as ReGain and Teen Counseling, and our BetterHelp Business and therapist acquisition web properties.
This is known as “first-party cross domain tracking”.
9Comply with lawsFor example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena.
In addition, Therapists are subject to certain legal requirements and professional obligations to have a full record and/or complete information of the care and services they provide you ("Clinical Health Record"), which must be retained for a certain amount of time following the conclusion of your care.
This is not unique to BetterHelp and is applicable to in-person therapy as well.
Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them.
Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that.
We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.
10Protect your safety and the safety of othersFor example, if we have reason to believe that you or any other person may be in immediate danger or your privacy has been infringed upon, we may use the information to investigate or reach out to you or the appropriate authorities if it is legally appropriate/permitted to do so.
11Send opportunities, promotions, news, updates and reminders about our services and your accountFor example, we might email you to offer you special promotions or discounts.
We might also email you to provide you with therapy related news or content that you might find interesting.
You can opt out of receiving texts or marketing communications at any time.
If you engage with us in a professional capacity on behalf of an organization, such as a BetterHelp Business Account Administrator, then we might email promotions, discounts, and therapy-related news and content we think might be relevant to your organization.
You can opt out of receiving texts or marketing communications at any time.
12Service ProviderWe define a Service Provider as a person or company that we have a legal agreement with to Process data collected by us or on our behalf.
Data that is Processed on our behalf is required to be done only at our direction - no other person or company can authorize it.
Our Service Providers are not permitted to disclose data that is individually identifiable to any other person or company, other than to us or the Service Providers’ own subcontractors provided that they’re bound to data Processing terms that are no less restrictive than the Service Provider’s terms.
The data obtained by Service Providers from their relationship with us must only be used for performing the services specified in our agreement with them, or as reasonably necessary to perform one or more of the following:Comply with applicable law, regulation, or legal process;Detect, prevent or mitigate fraud or security vulnerabilities;Debug to identify and repair errors impairing existing intended functionalities; and/orConduct internal research for technological development and demonstration of our products or services, if such use is reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the purpose for which the data was shared.
13External IdentifierAn identifier issued by or belonging to an external entity that is not BetterHelp (such as a Service Provider or Third Party) such as a “click” identifier, a cookie identifier or device identifier.
Examples of External Identifiers are the Google Click ID, Google Advertising ID, IDFA, Meta Click ID, and the TikTok click ID.
14Internal IdentifierAn identifier issued by, belonging to or hosted on-premises by BetterHelp that is unique to a user.
Examples of Internal Identifiers are User ID’s (and hashed User ID’s) and internal identifiers issued to conduct internal first-party analytics.
15Monitor and protect the security of the PlatformFor example, we process certain data to make sure only you are able to access your account, and to place controls or challenges to prevent unauthorized access.
We may also process some of your data when issuing security patches and bug fixes in order to address security risks.
We may also process your data to track potential abuse on the platform, prevent and detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.

This Program is optional, and Therapists may opt-out at any time.
Additional information about the Profile Boost Program, and the self-serve opt-out feature, is available on the Expertise and Preferences page of your Therapist Dashboard once you sign-up.
The legal basis for processing the above data for Therapists on our Platform (or for the purposes of recruiting them) are legitimate interest, performance of a contract, and consent.
In addition to processing, we also share some data with Service Providers12 in order for us to operate the Platform and to perform necessary website and application functions.
Additionally, when you opt into sharing, we share certain data with Third Parties.
For more information please see the section: "What are the purposes for sharing my data?
"If you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons (previously "Targeting cookies") some Visitor Data, excluding activity when you're logged in and have started therapy, may be shared for advertising purposes.
To learn more, see section, "Are you using my data for advertising?
".
Do you Process location data?
We process your IP address to determine your rough location so that we can personalize the platform for you.
For example, we show you relevant information about our service that applies to visitors from your country.
We also utilize your rough location to improve your user experience when using our platform.
For example we auto populate your state (if applicable) and country when you are completing our onboarding questionnaire.
We do not request or process exact location information such as information provided by your phone via GPS.
We Process your address information when you provide it as part of your emergency contact information when you start therapy on the Platform.
Your contact information is required to comply with therapy regulations and ethical code.
It can be used, for example, in case your Therapist believes you are in immediate danger.
When you are filing out this field, we may process your rough location to provide autocomplete suggestions for your convenience.
Rough location using your IP address is also Processed by the ReCAPTCHA security API tool we use.
ReCAPTCHA is a Service Provider we use to identify potentially malicious actors trying to access our site.
Here is the ReCAPTCHA Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
To learn about the additional purposes for which we Process IP addresses, please see:Why do you collect and Process my data?
Are you using my data for advertising?
Additional Privacy Notice for California ResidentsHow do we use Artificial Intelligence?
We use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) algorithms to support and develop features to provide you services and improve the quality of the services.
Our processing of data may include some automated and some human (or manual) methods of processing.
The automated processing typically includes features aimed at completing manual, repetitive tasks more efficiently.
For example, we may use AI features to detect security risks, synthesize information for customer service agents, and help therapists manage and document sessions more effectively.
We expect these improvements to ultimately improve our services and experiences for Members and Therapists.
To help ensure these tools remain fair and accurate, as well as protect the privacy of our Members and Therapists, we either thoroughly review a model or build it internally and, unless you agree otherwise, do not use any Therapy Data, such as sessions data, journal entries, messages, worksheets, or any other type of private communication you have with your Therapist in a session to train an AI or NLU model.
SECTION 2Data SharingWhat are the purposes for sharing my data?
Here's some more information about the purposes for which we share your data:Your data may be shared to comply with applicable laws.
For example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena.
This is not unique to BetterHelp and is applicable to in-person therapy as well.
Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them.
Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that.
We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.
Occasionally, your data may be handled by a select number of employees who are part of our parent company for support services.
These employees are under strict duties of confidentiality.
For example, a paralegal at our parent company may receive subpoenas or legal correspondence on behalf of Members or former Members and make sure they are provided to BetterHelp's Legal team to address.
We may share certain data with Service Providers12 that provide limited services that help us operate the Platform.
Examples include:Data hosting and storage providers: For example, cloud hosting providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Technology Service Providers: For example, we sometimes integrate tools into our Platform which give our Platform more functionality, like technology that helps us provide live audio, video and group meetings.
Customer Service Providers: For example, we use a tool that helps keep track of requests and questions from our Members, visitors and Therapists in a secure way.
Email management and communication Service Providers.
Email management and communication Service Providers: For example, we may use a tool that makes reaching out to you easier for us and more convenient for you.
Marketing and advertising Service Providers: For example, we may partner with an agency to run a marketing campaign or to help us better understand how to run our own campaigns to reach more people who may be interested in starting therapy.
Remember that Service Providers can only legally use data at our direction - no other person or company can authorize how they use it and they cannot disclose data that is individually identifiable to any other person or company, other than to us or the Service Providers' own subcontractors provided that they're bound to data Processing terms that are no less restrictive than the Service Provider's terms.
Billing and payment processing Service Providers: For example, we use Stripe to help process payments in a secure way.
Stripe also assists us in paying Therapists and issuing tax documents to them.
For this purpose, we may share email addresses of Therapists with Stripe and other data that is needed to pay Therapists such as a Therapist's name and tax ID.
Reporting and analytics Service Providers: For example, we might use a service to help us keep track of which pages and features are most used on our site.
Advisors and lawyers: To assist with business matters.
We may share some of your data with Service Providers to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and that of our users.
If you're a Therapist on our Platform, or being recruited to join us, in addition to the above, we may share certain data with Therapist recruiters in order to facilitate, monitor, and track the recruitment process.
If you are a Therapist on our Platform, we may also share certain data such as information you volunteer in or through the Platform including, but not limited to, your name, photograph, NPI (if applicable), information about your credentials, experience, specialties and qualifications with insurance payors or health plans for the purposes of contracting with them.
We may also share this information with vendors that accreditate/certify our therapist credentialing processes and otherwise help us streamline the credentialing process.
For Members who receive services in connection with an employer, organization, or other business partner, we may share group-level usage data, which cannot be directly connected to you, with your organization.
In the instance of Members who receive services through an Employee Assistance Program (“EAP”), your EAP will provide notice for any individual-level data which is shared with the EAP, if you are utilizing one and have provided them with consent for us to do so.
If you have any questions on how your data will be used by or shared with your EAP, please reach out to your EAP directly.
We may share some of your data in connection with an asset sale, merger or bankruptcy.
Note that if you make any information publicly available on the Platform, such as with a public post, anyone may see and use such information.
If you opt in to "Analytics (previously "Performance cookies")", we may use analytics cookies and other tracking technologies to share your data with trusted Service Providers that assist us to Process1 data for activities including but not limited to analyzing traffic sources, visits, and site interactions.
This analysis helps us to improve our products and services.
If you opt in to "Advertising (previously "Targeting cookies")" information regarding your activity on our websites, excluding activity when you're logged in and have started therapy, may be shared for advertising purposes.
For more information about your specific settings, see here.
To learn more, see section: "Are you using my data for advertising?
"How do you use my data to comply with the law?
When required by law, we cooperate with government agencies.
This is not unique to BetterHelp and is applicable to in-person therapy as well.
For example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena.
Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them.
Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that.
We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.
You should also be aware that Therapists may be obliged to disclose information to authorities to meet professional and legal responsibilities.
Specifically, some laws require mental health professionals to disclose information and/or take action for: (a) reported or suspected abuse; (b) serious suicidal potential; (c) threatened harm; and (d) court-ordered treatment.
You should speak with your Therapist if you have concerns about this.
Do you sell my data?
We aren't paid by anyone for any data.
However, in California, the laws define “sale” broadly to include the sharing of personal information in exchange for anything of value.
If you opt in to our use of Advertising cookies and web beacons, this use may be considered a “sale” of personal information under that specific California law.
For specific information on your data rights as a resident of California, see the additional notice for California residents.
Are you using my data for advertising?
In order to reach people who may be looking for mental health support, we advertise on some Third Party2 web properties such as Third Party websites and apps.
In order to minimize advertising costs related to this process and downstream costs to you, we strive to deliver ads that are relevant, interesting, and personal.
Therefore, if you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons, some Visitor Data, excluding activity when you're logged in and have started therapy, may be shared for advertising purposes.
As a result, you may see ads for our services on some Third Party websites.
If you use the App and have “Allowed” app to track using IOS or have opted into Advertising Cookies on Android, some data such as your mobile device identifier (IDFA and IDFV for iOS, and Android Advertising ID for Android) and data about how you use the App which is collected by our Service Provider Google (specifically GA4) will be used to make our Google advertising more effective.
This happens through an integration we have enabled between GA4 and Google Ads.
If you do not want to enable this, for Android users, you can navigate to “Sharing Settings” in the App and opt out of advertising.
For IOS users, you can “Ask App Not to Track” when you download the app or, at a later time, go to your device's privacy settings to see a list of apps that requested to track your activity (Go to Settings > Privacy & Security* > Tracking).
From there, you can tap to turn off or turn on permission to track for the BetterHelp app.
Even if you do opt in, we still do not engage in “retargeting” advertising.
Retargeting advertising is a type of advertising whereby advertisers leverage the fact that you viewed a page or took an action on their site to advertise to you again on third party properties in the hope that you will see the ad and return to their site.
To be clear, we don't share any data or information you share with your Therapist with any Third Party advertisers.
Even if you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons, we still don't share information with Third Party advertisers like Member names, phone numbers, clinician diagnosis, questionnaires answers, sessions data, journal entries, messages, worksheets, or any other type of private communication you have with your Therapist on the Platform.
As described further above at SECTION 2 Data Sharing, we may also partner with some Service Providers to assist in marketing campaigns.
Remember that in addition to needing a series of rigorous security standards (as further detailed here), Service Providers can only legally use data at our direction - no other person or company can authorize how they use it and they cannot disclose data that is individually identifiable to any other person or company, other than to us or the Service Providers' own subcontractors provided that they're bound to data Processing terms that are no less restrictive than the Service Provider's terms.
For additional information regarding Third Parties that BetterHelp may share data with, please reference our Third Party Partners Disclosure List.
SECTION 3Data Retention, Erasure, and ExportingHow long do you retain my data and how do I request data erasure?
BetterHelp is committed to ensuring that all applicable Member data is retained only for the amount of time required to provide relevant products and services and in accordance with relevant legal requirements.
Certain categories of data are retained for a period of time after you cancel your Membership or your Membership becomes inactive.
These categories of data are retained to allow for a seamless reactivation in the event you begin using our services again and allow Therapists to reference historical information.
Retaining this data is also needed to ensure our products and services function.
In addition to the data retention schedule outlined below, BetterHelp maintains a process for all Members (regardless of where they live) to receive and process, without undue delay, requests to erase or access their data.
The following sections describe both how long a Member can expect their data to be retained with respect to specific account information as well as how to request data erasure and access.
In this Policy, data erasure is defined as the permanent removal or obfuscation of identifiable data (See "What is this Privacy Policy") so that it is no longer accessible by anyone.
Retention PolicyBetterHelp’s data retention policies are based upon what data is being Processed1, whether or not the Member has participated in therapy, and if the Member proactively requested data erasure or if the erasure is triggered due to Platform inactivity.

BetterHelp Business Retention and ErasureBetterHelp Business: Retention PolicyWe automatically delete BetterHelp Business Data about an individual three years after either the end of their organization’s relationship with BetterHelp, or the initial collection, if no such relationship existed.
(e.
g.
, an individual provided information for a BetterHelp Business demo, but never purchased the product).
BetterHelp Business: Requesting Data Erasure…To manually request the deletion of your BetterHelp Business data before the timeframes described above, please select the "Update Email Preferences" link located in the footer of the BetterHelp Business webpage, as well as the banner at the bottom of any BetterHelp Business email we send.
On that linked webpage, please check the box next to "Delete my Data.
"Note: BetterHelp Business Data is not associated with BetterHelp Member Data.
As such, if we hold both BetterHelp Member Data and BetterHelp Business Data about you, then the retention schedules and processes outlined above apply only to the information we hold about you within those respective data categories.
For example, an Account Administrator who also uses BetterHelp as a Member would need to follow the process described in “Requesting Data Erasure…” to request the erasure of their Member data, and the process described in "BetterHelp Business: Requesting Data Erasure" to request the erasure of their BetterHelp Business Data.
SECTION 4Security and AnonymityHow do you keep my data secure?
We apply industry standards and strive to apply best practices to prevent any unauthorized access and disclosure.
Internet-based services carry inherent security risks, but our systems infrastructure, encryption technology, operation and processes are all designed, built, and maintained with your security and privacy in mind.
Our Platform is certified by HITRUST - one of the most recognized data security certification programs in the health industry.
BetterHelp has an experienced team of data security professionals whose job it is to make sure we use secure technology to protect your data.
We have an Information Security team who test internal security at BetterHelp to try and anticipate threat actors and act defensively to build processes and infrastructure to prevent incidents and attacks.
We have numerous robust security practices such as:All messages between a Member and their Therapist are secure and have 256-bit encryption.
Our servers are distributed across multiple Tier 3 AWS Data Centers for optimal security and protection.
Our browsing encryption system (SSL) follows modern best practices.
Our databases are encrypted and scrambled rendering them useless in the unlikely event that they are stolen or inappropriately retrieved.
We have robust monitoring and alerting systems and procedures in place that include both automated systems and humans.
For example, there are always security personnel active in our 24/7 rotation.
For your own security, keep the following in mind:Phishing: This is a type of online identity theft or account hacking.
We will never request your login information or credit card information in any non-secure or unsolicited communication.
You should always be diligent when you are asked to provide your account information and make sure it is in our secure system.
External links: Our Platform may contain links to an external website or service.
We do not control external websites, and do not have control over their privacy policies and terms of use.
The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization, or representation of our affiliation with that external party or of their privacy and security policies or practices.
Can I sign up for BetterHelp and remain anonymous?
When you sign up for an account on BetterHelp, we do not ask you for your full name.
You may pick any name or “nickname” which will identify you in the system.
You will need to provide an email address so that we can verify your account, and so we can communicate with you.
You can choose an email that does not include your name (including if you are coming to us from an employer, organization, or other business partner and do not want to use your organization’s email address), but you should be aware that in some jurisdictions emails may be considered “personal data,” “personally identifiable information,” or “sensitive personal data” in certain circumstances.
When you decide to start the therapy process, we’ll ask you for your contact information for emergency situations such as if your Therapist thinks that you or someone else is in immediate danger.
Your Therapist may request additional specific information about you as required by their license or other accreditation guidelines.
Even though we try to limit the kinds of information you must provide to us as discussed above, it is very difficult to be truly “anonymous” when you use any app or the internet.

Who can see the interactions I have with my Therapist?
You and your Therapist are able to see the messages you send, the worksheets you submit.
Your Therapist can also see the journal entries you submit if you opt in to sharing journal entries.
If you consent, a licensed Therapist who is employed as part of the BetterHelp Clinical Operations Team may review correspondence with your Therapist for quality assurance purposes.
For example, if you raise a concern about your Therapist, or if we have concerns about a specific Therapist’s clinical care.
In addition, our internal Trust and Safety or Legal teams may review correspondence for specific accounts if we have a reason to believe that there is a security, legal, or fraud issue occurring with that specific account.
Messages with your Therapist are not shared with any Third Party2, and your live sessions are not recorded.
We also do not share when you send a message, or have a session with your Therapist, with any Third Party.
How do you treat data from children?
We don’t knowingly collect or solicit any data or information from anyone under the age of thirteen (13) or knowingly allow such persons to become our users.

SECTION 7Defining key policy terms1ProcessIn this Policy, we refer generally to activities done with data as "Processing" or "Process.
" Examples of Processing include collecting, storing, and using data.
2Third PartyFor the purposes of this Policy, a Third Party means an entity that is not BetterHelp, not a Service Provider, not a Therapist or any other parties that are specifically called out in this Policy.
3Connect you with therapy servicesIn order for us to connect you with therapy services on our Platform, we need to be able to facilitate information sharing between you and your Therapist so that you can get the help you need from them.
We also Process data like your Therapist preferences, your state (if applicable), and your country to determine what Therapist to suggest to you based on applicable licensing or accreditation requirements.
4Facilitate tools for you and your TherapistOnce you start therapy, we need to process certain data to enable therapy tools within the Platform such as journal entries, setting goals and providing relevant worksheets.
These help facilitate a more effective therapeutic experience and outcome.
5Communicate with youFor example, we need to make sure that if you ask a question or have a concern about the Platform, we’re able to respond to you and provide an answer.
Additionally, if you represent an organizational customer, such as a business or nonprofit, then the BetterHelp Business team may contact you in your professional capacity to service your organization’s account, answer questions, and provide support.
6Monitor and improve therapy qualityFor example, we track if a live session occurred, was canceled, or if the Therapist did not show up, to ensure that timely services are being delivered to you.
We also track ratings, reviews, complaints, and other client feedback to ensure the quality of Therapists on our Platform.
If you consent, a licensed Therapist who is employed as part of the BetterHelp Clinical Operations Team may review correspondence with your Therapist for quality assurance purposes.
For example, if you raise a concern about your Therapist, or we have concerns about a specific Therapist’s clinical care.
In addition, our internal Trust and Safety or Legal teams may review correspondence for specific accounts if we have a reason to believe that there is a security, legal, or fraud issue occurring with that specific account.
7Personalize your web or app experienceFor example, if you identify as a Member of the LGBTQ+ community and would prefer a Therapist who has relevant expertise, experience, and training to provide therapy services for LGBTQ+ Members, we Process information to allow us to match you with an appropriate Therapist that can meet these needs.
Another example is if you state that you would like help with anxiety, we may recommend content and features that would be helpful to you, such as anxiety-related group sessions.
8Help us understand how you use our services, how we can improve our products and services to make them more effective and convenient, and offer you new featuresFor example, we may use some of your data to determine which products and features to roll out, which features are popular and require more investment or resources, or decide to remove features that are not providing value.
We may also Process data to know when you have already seen certain notifications on the Platform and do not need to be shown them again.
Another example of this is when we use your IP address to help conveniently auto-populate your state (if applicable) and country, or assist you with providing your address when completing information about your emergency contact.
We may also track regular usage of certain pages, buttons, or features on the Platform in order to allocate our research and development resources appropriately.
In addition, if you opt in to Analytics (previously “Performance cookies”), we may process some data to track site visits across our sister sites such as ReGain and Teen Counseling, and our BetterHelp Business and therapist acquisition web properties.
This is known as “first-party cross domain tracking”.
9Comply with lawsFor example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena.
In addition, Therapists are subject to certain legal requirements and professional obligations to have a full record and/or complete information of the care and services they provide you ("Clinical Health Record"), which must be retained for a certain amount of time following the conclusion of your care.
This is not unique to BetterHelp and is applicable to in-person therapy as well.
Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them.
Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that.
We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.
10Protect your safety and the safety of othersFor example, if we have reason to believe that you or any other person may be in immediate danger or your privacy has been infringed upon, we may use the information to investigate or reach out to you or the appropriate authorities if it is legally appropriate/permitted to do so.
11Send opportunities, promotions, news, updates and reminders about our services and your accountFor example, we might email you to offer you special promotions or discounts.
We might also email you to provide you with therapy related news or content that you might find interesting.
You can opt out of receiving texts or marketing communications at any time.
If you engage with us in a professional capacity on behalf of an organization, such as a BetterHelp Business Account Administrator, then we might email promotions, discounts, and therapy-related news and content we think might be relevant to your organization.
You can opt out of receiving texts or marketing communications at any time.
12Service ProviderWe define a Service Provider as a person or company that we have a legal agreement with to Process data collected by us or on our behalf.
Data that is Processed on our behalf is required to be done only at our direction - no other person or company can authorize it.
Our Service Providers are not permitted to disclose data that is individually identifiable to any other person or company, other than to us or the Service Providers’ own subcontractors provided that they’re bound to data Processing terms that are no less restrictive than the Service Provider’s terms.
The data obtained by Service Providers from their relationship with us must only be used for performing the services specified in our agreement with them, or as reasonably necessary to perform one or more of the following:Comply with applicable law, regulation, or legal process;Detect, prevent or mitigate fraud or security vulnerabilities;Debug to identify and repair errors impairing existing intended functionalities; and/orConduct internal research for technological development and demonstration of our products or services, if such use is reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the purpose for which the data was shared.
13External IdentifierAn identifier issued by or belonging to an external entity that is not BetterHelp (such as a Service Provider or Third Party) such as a “click” identifier, a cookie identifier or device identifier.
Examples of External Identifiers are the Google Click ID, Google Advertising ID, IDFA, Meta Click ID, and the TikTok click ID.
14Internal IdentifierAn identifier issued by, belonging to or hosted on-premises by BetterHelp that is unique to a user.
Examples of Internal Identifiers are User ID’s (and hashed User ID’s) and internal identifiers issued to conduct internal first-party analytics.
15Monitor and protect the security of the PlatformFor example, we process certain data to make sure only you are able to access your account, and to place controls or challenges to prevent unauthorized access.
We may also process some of your data when issuing security patches and bug fixes in order to address security risks.
We may also process your data to track potential abuse on the platform, prevent and detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.

Additional Privacy Notice for California ResidentsHow do we use Artificial Intelligence?
We use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) algorithms to support and develop features to provide you services and improve the quality of the services.

We expect these improvements to ultimately improve our services and experiences for Members and Therapists.
To help ensure these tools remain fair and accurate, as well as protect the privacy of our Members and Therapists, we either thoroughly review a model or build it internally and, unless you agree otherwise, do not use any Therapy Data, such as sessions data, journal entries, messages, worksheets, or any other type of private communication you have with your Therapist in a session to train an AI or NLU model.

How do we use Artificial Intelligence?



We use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) algorithms to support and develop features to provide you services and improve the quality of the services.
Our processing of data may include some automated and some human (or manual) methods of processing.
The automated processing typically includes features aimed at completing manual, repetitive tasks more efficiently.
For example, we may use AI features to detect security risks, synthesize information for customer service agents, and help therapists manage and document sessions more effectively.
We expect these improvements to ultimately improve our services and experiences for Members and Therapists.
To help ensure these tools remain fair and accurate, as well as protect the privacy of our Members and Therapists, we either thoroughly review a model or build it internally and, unless you agree otherwise, do not use any Therapy Data, such as sessions data, journal entries, messages, worksheets, or any other type of private communication you have with your Therapist in a session to train an AI or NLU model.

SECTION 2Data Sharing



What are the purposes for sharing my data?
Here's some more information about the purposes for which we share your data:Your data may be shared to comply with applicable laws.
For example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena.
This is not unique to BetterHelp and is applicable to in-person therapy as well.
Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them.
Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that.
We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.
Occasionally, your data may be handled by a select number of employees who are part of our parent company for support services.
These employees are under strict duties of confidentiality.
For example, a paralegal at our parent company may receive subpoenas or legal correspondence on behalf of Members or former Members and make sure they are provided to BetterHelp's Legal team to address.
We may share certain data with Service Providers12 that provide limited services that help us operate the Platform.
Examples include:Data hosting and storage providers: For example, cloud hosting providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Technology Service Providers: For example, we sometimes integrate tools into our Platform which give our Platform more functionality, like technology that helps us provide live audio, video and group meetings.
Customer Service Providers: For example, we use a tool that helps keep track of requests and questions from our Members, visitors and Therapists in a secure way.
Email management and communication Service Providers.
Email management and communication Service Providers: For example, we may use a tool that makes reaching out to you easier for us and more convenient for you.
Marketing and advertising Service Providers: For example, we may partner with an agency to run a marketing campaign or to help us better understand how to run our own campaigns to reach more people who may be interested in starting therapy.
Remember that Service Providers can only legally use data at our direction - no other person or company can authorize how they use it and they cannot disclose data that is individually identifiable to any other person or company, other than to us or the Service Providers' own subcontractors provided that they're bound to data Processing terms that are no less restrictive than the Service Provider's terms.
Billing and payment processing Service Providers: For example, we use Stripe to help process payments in a secure way.
Stripe also assists us in paying Therapists and issuing tax documents to them.
For this purpose, we may share email addresses of Therapists with Stripe and other data that is needed to pay Therapists such as a Therapist's name and tax ID.
Reporting and analytics Service Providers: For example, we might use a service to help us keep track of which pages and features are most used on our site.
Advisors and lawyers: To assist with business matters.
We may share some of your data with Service Providers to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and that of our users.
If you're a Therapist on our Platform, or being recruited to join us, in addition to the above, we may share certain data with Therapist recruiters in order to facilitate, monitor, and track the recruitment process.
If you are a Therapist on our Platform, we may also share certain data such as information you volunteer in or through the Platform including, but not limited to, your name, photograph, NPI (if applicable), information about your credentials, experience, specialties and qualifications with insurance payors or health plans for the purposes of contracting with them.
We may also share this information with vendors that accreditate/certify our therapist credentialing processes and otherwise help us streamline the credentialing process.
For Members who receive services in connection with an employer, organization, or other business partner, we may share group-level usage data, which cannot be directly connected to you, with your organization.
In the instance of Members who receive services through an Employee Assistance Program (“EAP”), your EAP will provide notice for any individual-level data which is shared with the EAP, if you are utilizing one and have provided them with consent for us to do so.
If you have any questions on how your data will be used by or shared with your EAP, please reach out to your EAP directly.
We may share some of your data in connection with an asset sale, merger or bankruptcy.
Note that if you make any information publicly available on the Platform, such as with a public post, anyone may see and use such information.
If you opt in to "Analytics (previously "Performance cookies")", we may use analytics cookies and other tracking technologies to share your data with trusted Service Providers that assist us to Process1 data for activities including but not limited to analyzing traffic sources, visits, and site interactions.
This analysis helps us to improve our products and services.
If you opt in to "Advertising (previously "Targeting cookies")" information regarding your activity on our websites, excluding activity when you're logged in and have started therapy, may be shared for advertising purposes.
For more information about your specific settings, see here.
To learn more, see section: "Are you using my data for advertising?
"How do you use my data to comply with the law?
When required by law, we cooperate with government agencies.
This is not unique to BetterHelp and is applicable to in-person therapy as well.
For example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena.
Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them.
Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that.
We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.
You should also be aware that Therapists may be obliged to disclose information to authorities to meet professional and legal responsibilities.
Specifically, some laws require mental health professionals to disclose information and/or take action for: (a) reported or suspected abuse; (b) serious suicidal potential; (c) threatened harm; and (d) court-ordered treatment.
You should speak with your Therapist if you have concerns about this.
Do you sell my data?
We aren't paid by anyone for any data.
However, in California, the laws define “sale” broadly to include the sharing of personal information in exchange for anything of value.
If you opt in to our use of Advertising cookies and web beacons, this use may be considered a “sale” of personal information under that specific California law.
For specific information on your data rights as a resident of California, see the additional notice for California residents.
Are you using my data for advertising?
In order to reach people who may be looking for mental health support, we advertise on some Third Party2 web properties such as Third Party websites and apps.
In order to minimize advertising costs related to this process and downstream costs to you, we strive to deliver ads that are relevant, interesting, and personal.
Therefore, if you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons, some Visitor Data, excluding activity when you're logged in and have started therapy, may be shared for advertising purposes.
As a result, you may see ads for our services on some Third Party websites.
If you use the App and have “Allowed” app to track using IOS or have opted into Advertising Cookies on Android, some data such as your mobile device identifier (IDFA and IDFV for iOS, and Android Advertising ID for Android) and data about how you use the App which is collected by our Service Provider Google (specifically GA4) will be used to make our Google advertising more effective.
This happens through an integration we have enabled between GA4 and Google Ads.
If you do not want to enable this, for Android users, you can navigate to “Sharing Settings” in the App and opt out of advertising.
For IOS users, you can “Ask App Not to Track” when you download the app or, at a later time, go to your device's privacy settings to see a list of apps that requested to track your activity (Go to Settings > Privacy & Security* > Tracking).
From there, you can tap to turn off or turn on permission to track for the BetterHelp app.
Even if you do opt in, we still do not engage in “retargeting” advertising.
Retargeting advertising is a type of advertising whereby advertisers leverage the fact that you viewed a page or took an action on their site to advertise to you again on third party properties in the hope that you will see the ad and return to their site.
To be clear, we don't share any data or information you share with your Therapist with any Third Party advertisers.
Even if you opt in to Advertising cookies and web beacons, we still don't share information with Third Party advertisers like Member names, phone numbers, clinician diagnosis, questionnaires answers, sessions data, journal entries, messages, worksheets, or any other type of private communication you have with your Therapist on the Platform.
As described further above at SECTION 2 Data Sharing, we may also partner with some Service Providers to assist in marketing campaigns.
Remember that in addition to needing a series of rigorous security standards (as further detailed here), Service Providers can only legally use data at our direction - no other person or company can authorize how they use it and they cannot disclose data that is individually identifiable to any other person or company, other than to us or the Service Providers' own subcontractors provided that they're bound to data Processing terms that are no less restrictive than the Service Provider's terms.
For additional information regarding Third Parties that BetterHelp may share data with, please reference our Third Party Partners Disclosure List.



What are the purposes for sharing my data?



Here's some more information about the purposes for which we share your data:Your data may be shared to comply with applicable laws.
For example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena.
This is not unique to BetterHelp and is applicable to in-person therapy as well.
Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them.
Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that.
We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.
Occasionally, your data may be handled by a select number of employees who are part of our parent company for support services.
These employees are under strict duties of confidentiality.
For example, a paralegal at our parent company may receive subpoenas or legal correspondence on behalf of Members or former Members and make sure they are provided to BetterHelp's Legal team to address.
We may share certain data with Service Providers12 that provide limited services that help us operate the Platform.
Examples include:Data hosting and storage providers: For example, cloud hosting providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Technology Service Providers: For example, we sometimes integrate tools into our Platform which give our Platform more functionality, like technology that helps us provide live audio, video and group meetings.
Customer Service Providers: For example, we use a tool that helps keep track of requests and questions from our Members, visitors and Therapists in a secure way.
Email management and communication Service Providers.
Email management and communication Service Providers: For example, we may use a tool that makes reaching out to you easier for us and more convenient for you.
Marketing and advertising Service Providers: For example, we may partner with an agency to run a marketing campaign or to help us better understand how to run our own campaigns to reach more people who may be interested in starting therapy.
Remember that Service Providers can only legally use data at our direction - no other person or company can authorize how they use it and they cannot disclose data that is individually identifiable to any other person or company, other than to us or the Service Providers' own subcontractors provided that they're bound to data Processing terms that are no less restrictive than the Service Provider's terms.
Billing and payment processing Service Providers: For example, we use Stripe to help process payments in a secure way.
Stripe also assists us in paying Therapists and issuing tax documents to them.
For this purpose, we may share email addresses of Therapists with Stripe and other data that is needed to pay Therapists such as a Therapist's name and tax ID.
Reporting and analytics Service Providers: For example, we might use a service to help us keep track of which pages and features are most used on our site.
Advisors and lawyers: To assist with business matters.
We may share some of your data with Service Providers to ensure the safety and security of the Platform and that of our users.
If you're a Therapist on our Platform, or being recruited to join us, in addition to the above, we may share certain data with Therapist recruiters in order to facilitate, monitor, and track the recruitment process.
If you are a Therapist on our Platform, we may also share certain data such as information you volunteer in or through the Platform including, but not limited to, your name, photograph, NPI (if applicable), information about your credentials, experience, specialties and qualifications with insurance payors or health plans for the purposes of contracting with them.
We may also share this information with vendors that accreditate/certify our therapist credentialing processes and otherwise help us streamline the credentialing process.
For Members who receive services in connection with an employer, organization, or other business partner, we may share group-level usage data, which cannot be directly connected to you, with your organization.
In the instance of Members who receive services through an Employee Assistance Program (“EAP”), your EAP will provide notice for any individual-level data which is shared with the EAP, if you are utilizing one and have provided them with consent for us to do so.
If you have any questions on how your data will be used by or shared with your EAP, please reach out to your EAP directly.
We may share some of your data in connection with an asset sale, merger or bankruptcy.
Note that if you make any information publicly available on the Platform, such as with a public post, anyone may see and use such information.
If you opt in to "Analytics (previously "Performance cookies")", we may use analytics cookies and other tracking technologies to share your data with trusted Service Providers that assist us to Process1 data for activities including but not limited to analyzing traffic sources, visits, and site interactions.
This analysis helps us to improve our products and services.
If you opt in to "Advertising (previously "Targeting cookies")" information regarding your activity on our websites, excluding activity when you're logged in and have started therapy, may be shared for advertising purposes.

SECTION 4Security and Anonymity



How do you keep my data secure?
We apply industry standards and strive to apply best practices to prevent any unauthorized access and disclosure.
Internet-based services carry inherent security risks, but our systems infrastructure, encryption technology, operation and processes are all designed, built, and maintained with your security and privacy in mind.
Our Platform is certified by HITRUST - one of the most recognized data security certification programs in the health industry.
BetterHelp has an experienced team of data security professionals whose job it is to make sure we use secure technology to protect your data.
We have an Information Security team who test internal security at BetterHelp to try and anticipate threat actors and act defensively to build processes and infrastructure to prevent incidents and attacks.
We have numerous robust security practices such as:All messages between a Member and their Therapist are secure and have 256-bit encryption.
Our servers are distributed across multiple Tier 3 AWS Data Centers for optimal security and protection.
Our browsing encryption system (SSL) follows modern best practices.
Our databases are encrypted and scrambled rendering them useless in the unlikely event that they are stolen or inappropriately retrieved.
We have robust monitoring and alerting systems and procedures in place that include both automated systems and humans.
For example, there are always security personnel active in our 24/7 rotation.
For your own security, keep the following in mind:Phishing: This is a type of online identity theft or account hacking.
We will never request your login information or credit card information in any non-secure or unsolicited communication.
You should always be diligent when you are asked to provide your account information and make sure it is in our secure system.
External links: Our Platform may contain links to an external website or service.
We do not control external websites, and do not have control over their privacy policies and terms of use.
The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization, or representation of our affiliation with that external party or of their privacy and security policies or practices.
Can I sign up for BetterHelp and remain anonymous?
When you sign up for an account on BetterHelp, we do not ask you for your full name.
You may pick any name or “nickname” which will identify you in the system.
You will need to provide an email address so that we can verify your account, and so we can communicate with you.
You can choose an email that does not include your name (including if you are coming to us from an employer, organization, or other business partner and do not want to use your organization’s email address), but you should be aware that in some jurisdictions emails may be considered “personal data,” “personally identifiable information,” or “sensitive personal data” in certain circumstances.
When you decide to start the therapy process, we’ll ask you for your contact information for emergency situations such as if your Therapist thinks that you or someone else is in immediate danger.
Your Therapist may request additional specific information about you as required by their license or other accreditation guidelines.
Even though we try to limit the kinds of information you must provide to us as discussed above, it is very difficult to be truly “anonymous” when you use any app or the internet.

Additionally, if you represent an organizational customer, such as a business or nonprofit, then the BetterHelp Business team may contact you in your professional capacity to service your organization’s account, answer questions, and provide support.
6Monitor and improve therapy qualityFor example, we track if a live session occurred, was canceled, or if the Therapist did not show up, to ensure that timely services are being delivered to you.
We also track ratings, reviews, complaints, and other client feedback to ensure the quality of Therapists on our Platform.
If you consent, a licensed Therapist who is employed as part of the BetterHelp Clinical Operations Team may review correspondence with your Therapist for quality assurance purposes.
For example, if you raise a concern about your Therapist, or we have concerns about a specific Therapist’s clinical care.
In addition, our internal Trust and Safety or Legal teams may review correspondence for specific accounts if we have a reason to believe that there is a security, legal, or fraud issue occurring with that specific account.
7Personalize your web or app experienceFor example, if you identify as a Member of the LGBTQ+ community and would prefer a Therapist who has relevant expertise, experience, and training to provide therapy services for LGBTQ+ Members, we Process information to allow us to match you with an appropriate Therapist that can meet these needs.
Another example is if you state that you would like help with anxiety, we may recommend content and features that would be helpful to you, such as anxiety-related group sessions.
8Help us understand how you use our services, how we can improve our products and services to make them more effective and convenient, and offer you new featuresFor example, we may use some of your data to determine which products and features to roll out, which features are popular and require more investment or resources, or decide to remove features that are not providing value.
We may also Process data to know when you have already seen certain notifications on the Platform and do not need to be shown them again.
Another example of this is when we use your IP address to help conveniently auto-populate your state (if applicable) and country, or assist you with providing your address when completing information about your emergency contact.
We may also track regular usage of certain pages, buttons, or features on the Platform in order to allocate our research and development resources appropriately.
In addition, if you opt in to Analytics (previously “Performance cookies”), we may process some data to track site visits across our sister sites such as ReGain and Teen Counseling, and our BetterHelp Business and therapist acquisition web properties.
This is known as “first-party cross domain tracking”.
9Comply with lawsFor example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena.
In addition, Therapists are subject to certain legal requirements and professional obligations to have a full record and/or complete information of the care and services they provide you ("Clinical Health Record"), which must be retained for a certain amount of time following the conclusion of your care.
This is not unique to BetterHelp and is applicable to in-person therapy as well.
Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them.
Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that.
We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.
10Protect your safety and the safety of othersFor example, if we have reason to believe that you or any other person may be in immediate danger or your privacy has been infringed upon, we may use the information to investigate or reach out to you or the appropriate authorities if it is legally appropriate/permitted to do so.
11Send opportunities, promotions, news, updates and reminders about our services and your accountFor example, we might email you to offer you special promotions or discounts.
We might also email you to provide you with therapy related news or content that you might find interesting.
You can opt out of receiving texts or marketing communications at any time.
If you engage with us in a professional capacity on behalf of an organization, such as a BetterHelp Business Account Administrator, then we might email promotions, discounts, and therapy-related news and content we think might be relevant to your organization.

• Your data may be shared to comply with applicable laws. For example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena. This is not unique to BetterHelp and is applicable to in-person therapy as well. Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them. Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that. We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.
• Occasionally, your data may be handled by a select number of employees who are part of our parent company for support services. These employees are under strict duties of confidentiality. For example, a paralegal at our parent company may receive subpoenas or legal correspondence on behalf of Members or former Members and make sure they are provided to BetterHelp's Legal team to address.
