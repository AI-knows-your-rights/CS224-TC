For clarity, this indemnification applies both to direct claims between You and Turnitin and third-party claims. You agree to cooperate as reasonably required in the defense of any claim. Turnitin reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification under this section and, in any event, You agree not to settle any such matter without the prior written consent of Turnitin. Your obligation to defend and indemnify Turnitin survives the termination of this User Agreement and Your use of the Site.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Modification of these terms and conditions</strong></p>
<p>Turnitin reserves the right to change the terms, conditions, and notices under which the Site is offered from time to time and without prior notice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>General</strong></p>
<p>(a) This User Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A. You hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of state and federal courts in Alameda County, California, U.S.A., in all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the Site or the Services. You agree not to use the Site in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these terms and conditions, including without limitation this paragraph.</p>
<p>(b) This User Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between You and Turnitin and governs Your use of the Services (but excluding any services which Turnitin may provide to You under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between You and Turnitin in relation to the Services, except for a Registration Agreement as provided below.</p>
<p>(c) This agreement is assignable by Turnitin, including in connection with the sale of its business or reorganization or reincorporation. You may not assign or transfer the agreement without the prior permission of Turnitin, including in connection with a change of control. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship exists between You and Turnitin, LLC as a result of this User Agreement or use of the Site or the Services.</p>
<p>(d) Turnitin's performance of this User Agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in this User Agreement is in derogation of Turnitin's right to comply with law enforcement requests or requirements relating to Your use of the Site or the Services or information provided to or gathered by Turnitin's with respect to such use.</p>
<p>(e) To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, You agree that any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the Site or the Services must be commenced within one (1) year after the cause of action arose. Otherwise, such claim or cause of action is barred forever.</p>
<p>(f) You agree that Turnitin may provide You with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Services.</p>
<p>(g) If any part of this User Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision; the remainder of the User Agreement shall continue in effect. You agree that if Turnitin does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in this User Agreement (or which Turnitin has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Turnitin's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Turnitin.</p>
<p>(h) <strong>The Site is controlled by Turnitin from its offices within the State of California, United States of America and the papers and personal data and any other information You submit to Turnitin may be submitted to and may be stored on its servers located in the United States. Turnitin makes no representation that materials in the Site are appropriate or available for use outside of the United States. Those who choose to access the Site from other locations do so on their own initiative and at their own risk and are responsible for compliance with applicable laws.</strong></p>
<p>(i) Turnitin, LLC and other names of Turnitin products and/or services included on the Site are the trademarks and service marks of Turnitin. Turnitin's trademarks and service marks may not be used in connection with any product or service that is not Turnitin's, in any manner that is likely to cause confusion among customers without express written permission. All other trademarks, service marks and logos used in the Site are the trademarks, service marks or logos of their respective owners. Turnitin does not make any claims to the marks of others which might appear on the Site. You gain no right to use any marks of Turnitin or any other entity by virtue of Your use of the Site.</p>
<p>(j) The Site contains hyperlinks to third party Websites. External hyperlinks to or from the Site do not constitute Turnitin's endorsement of, affiliation with, or recommendation of any third party or its Web site, products, resources or other information. Turnitin is not responsible for any software, data or other information available from any third party Website. You are solely responsible for complying with all terms and conditions of use for the third party sites. You acknowledge that Turnitin shall have no liability for any damage or loss arising from Your access to, use of or reliance on any third party Web site, software, data, or other information.</p>
<p>(k) If You are an instructor, employee or agent of a Customer, the terms of the User Agreement are in addition to those contained in any written registration agreement or terms of use  Customer may have with Turnitin, LLC (each, a "Registration Agreement"). In the event of a conflict between this User Agreement and any such separate Registration Agreement, the terms of the Registration Agreement shall govern. Except in the event that your employer or client (in the case of an agent) has entered into a Registration Agreement with Turnitin, this User Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the user and Turnitin's with respect to usage of the Site and the Services and it supersedes all prior communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written, between the user and Turnitin's with respect to usage of the Site or the Services. A printed version of this User Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the User agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.</p></li></ol>
<p><strong>**Section B (applicable only to Users in the European Union)</strong></p>
<ol><li><p>Turnitin is compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) effective as of 25 May 2018. The legal basis for the processing of Your Personal Data is that such processing is necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest or in the exercise of the official authority vested in the Controller (Article 6(1)(e) GDPR). The 'Controller' is the institution instructing You to submit Your work through the Turnitin service, and they have official authority to subject Your work to originality checks. As such, Your consent to such processing is not required. Turnitin's Data Protection Officer can be contacted at <span class="underline">DPO@turnitin.com</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Where the Controller is not a public authority, processing of Your Personal Data is also lawful because it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Controller (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR).</p></li>
<li><p>The provision of Your Personal Data is necessary in order for Your institution to perform its contract with Turnitin. You are obliged to provide Your Personal Data so that Your institution can carry out the official authority vested in it to assess Your work. Failure to do so may have adverse consequences with regard to Your relationship with Your institution or may be contrary to any terms of use You have agreed with your institution.</p></li>
<li><p>Turnitin may transfer Your Personal Data from the European Economic Area to the USA. When it does so, adequate safeguards are in place to ensure that the Personal Data is handled securely in the USA. Turnitin is Privacy Shield certified, a mechanism recognized by the European Commission as being adequate. Turnitin's Privacy Shield certification can be viewed at <span class="underline">www.privacyshield.gov/list</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Turnitin adheres to the EU Model Contract Clauses on data transfer (according to EU Commission Decision 87/2010/EC). The EU Model Contract Clauses are also recognized as an adequate mechanism by the European Commission.</p></li>
<li><p>Where a sub-processor is utilized in the performance of the Turnitin Services, they will be restricted to those sub-processors that are necessary in the technical performance of the Services, such as data centre and software providers. Turnitin ensures that such sub-processors are GDPR compliant by way of written contracts.</p></li>
<li><p>Your Personal Data is encrypted in storage. Unless otherwise instructed by the Controller, it will be stored indefinitely in encrypted form and may be used to assess originality of other submissions in the future. Turnitin adds student papers to a private, proprietary database (which is not publically accessible) indefinitely unless its customer requests deletion of such Personal Data. Such archiving is compatible with the purposes for which the Personal data was collected.</p></li>
<li><p>You have the right to request from the Controller (Your institution) access to, rectification of, or erasure of Personal Data, or restriction of such processing as well as the right to Personal Data portability. You have the right to complain to the Controller and/or your national Supervisory Authority in the event of non-compliance.</p></li>
<li><p>No automated decision making or profiling is undertaken by Turnitin in relation to Your Personal Data.</p></li>
<li><p>Your institution may decide to process Your Personal data.</p></li>
<li><p>The terms and conditions in Section A above shall apply to your use of the Services, <span class="underline"><strong>except that</strong></span>:</p>
<p>a.    Turnitin's processing of your Personal Data is governed exclusively by the GDPR;</p>
<p>b.    If a conflict between Section A and Section B exists, Section B shall govern; and</p>
<p>c.    Consent to the processing of Your Personal Data is not required due to the lawful basis for processing described at Section B, paragraphs 1 and 2 above.</p></li>
<li><p>Your 'click-through' of this User Agreement signifies that you have <strong>read</strong> and <strong>understood</strong> the information within it.</p></li></ol>
