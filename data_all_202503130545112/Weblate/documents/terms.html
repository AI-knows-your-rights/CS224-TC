<h2>
  Methods of Acceptance

</p>

<p class="item">

  <li>
    on the day of signing by both parties (especially for all Services offered with custom settings);
  </li>
  <li>
    online through acceptance (confirmation) via the web interface in accordance with the Price List, with the Agreement becoming effective once the Price for the License has been duly paid (in the case of a bank transfer, once the amount corresponding to the Price for the License has been credited to the Provider's bank account) for the amount stated in the first billing period by the User.
  </li>
</ol>




<h2>
  Service Provision
</h2>

<p class="item">
  The Provider operates the Service at the internet address specified in the Product specification and its subdomains or on the User's Servers in accordance with the Agreement and the technical specifications outlined in the Product specification.
</p>

<p class="item">
  If the Agreement is concluded under Article 2.3(a), the scope of Services is defined in the Product specification, which is attached to the Agreement. The Product specification may further detail the scope of individual (sub)services regarding their content and activation methods. The Product specification defined in this manner takes precedence over the form of Service offered according to the Price List.
</p>

<p class="item">
  The Service is provided in three forms of cooperation: Hosted Weblate, Dedicated Weblate, and Self-hosting.
</p>

<p class="item">
  In accordance with GPLv3, certain aspects of the Service may be provided either with the assistance of third parties other than the Provider or directly by these parties. The User acknowledges that these third parties will provide their services in accordance with this Agreement and the GPLv3 license. The User acknowledges that third parties involved in the provision of the Service may change over the course of the Service's provision. These third parties may process Personal Data within their activities in accordance with the Agreement and GPLv3.
</p>

<h2>
  Service Duration
</h2>

<p class="item">
  Unless otherwise expressly agreed in the Agreement, the Agreement is concluded for a period corresponding to a subscription model. The subscription can be paid monthly or annually in accordance with Article 5 of the GTC.
</p>

<h2>
  Price
</h2>

<p class="item">
  The price for the Service is determined according to the offer or the Price List. The User acknowledges and agrees that the Price List may be unilaterally changed by the Provider in the same way as these GTC. The price depends on the chosen Service configuration, and there are many variants in which the Service can be provided. These variants are listed in the Price List. The price for Services consists of the following separate items or their combination, which are paid regularly monthly/annually:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    regular price for access to Services, which is also always set for the relevant time period and based on the specific conditions of the Service, but paid monthly or annually, with this price varying for different forms of collaboration according to the Price List;
  </li>
  <li>
    regular price for the number of Hosted Strings; this amount is chosen by the User from the options offered in the Price List or in agreement with the Provider;
  </li>
  <li>
    regular price for Translation Memory;
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  (points a), b), and c) are collectively referred to as the "<strong>Subscription</strong>").
</p>

<p class="item">
  To avoid doubt, the Subscription may guarantee either only access to a specific Product or License and/or a specific package of guaranteed Services.
</p>

<p class="item">
  The User is obliged to pay the Price based on the received tax documents (invoices) issued by the Provider. The Price is paid in advance, and the invoice is issued and delivered to the User within 5 working days after the end of each relevant period.
</p>

<p class="item">
  Payment of the Price may be made by credit card, bank transfer, or cryptocurrency transaction. All Prices listed in the Price List exclude VAT. End users from the EU and Czech business companies will be required to pay an additional VAT of 21%. Reverse charge applies to invoices issued to businesses within the EU.
</p>

<p class="item">
  If the User wishes to avoid being charged for the Service in the Subscription mode, they must cancel the Subscription at least three days before the automatic renewal of the Service usage. The Provider recommends verifying with the prepaid card issuer or bank whether recurring billing is possible.
</p>

<p class="item">
  The User can change their Subscription mode online by logging into their User Account and making the change or cancelling the Subscription there. If the User cancels their Subscription at least three days before the renewal date as per point 5.5 above, their Subscription will stop at the end of the current billing cycle.
</p>

<p class="item">
  The Provider does not refund ANY money for Services, Support Services, and/or any other services provided under the Agreement and these GTC if they were provided before the cancellation of these Services by the User. Order cancellation after payment is possible by agreement if the ordered Service has not been used or no attempt to download it has been made. If a download attempt has been made, no negotiation will occur, and the User is not entitled to any refunds, discounts, or other monetary compensation. If prepaid Services were prepaid for a period exceeding the actual usage period, the conditions of such a refund will be agreed upon individually.
</p>

<p class="item">
  Prices and Subscription conditions may change unilaterally by the Operator at any time. The price and conditions valid at the time of the first purchase or the last Subscription renewal remain in effect for the duration of the given Subscription period, but new prices and conditions may apply to renewals or new Subscriptions. The Provider will notify the User of any price or Subscription condition changes in a reasonable period before the new Price or conditions come into effect. Under these conditions, the User has the right to cancel the Subscription.
</p>

During the suspension or limitation of the provision of the Service, the User is still obliged to pay the Price according to the delivered tax documents. Repeated payment delays by the User are considered a material breach of the Agreement, entitling the Provider to terminate the Agreement for the reason stated in Article 11 below.
</p>

<p class="item">
  By agreeing to the GTC at the time of purchase, the User subscribes to the future automatic renewal of the Subscription. The Subscription will be automatically renewed at the end of each Subscription period based on the Subscription period chosen at the time of purchase.

  Provider's Rights and Obligations
</h2>

<p class="item">
  The Provider is entitled to make any changes to the Service or its scope. In such a case, the Provider will inform the User through the web interface related to the provided Service. In the event of changes in the legal or regulatory framework, industry standards, the Provider's related costs, market customs, conditions affecting the relevant market, or any other changes that may impact the provision of the Service, the Provider may at any time amend, cancel, or supplement these Terms (referred to as "<strong>Change</strong>") by notifying the User of such Change by posting the revised version of these Terms on the Website and notifying the User via email and through the interface related to the provided Service, at least 14 days before the Change takes effect. If the User does not respond to such Change within the above-mentioned period, it will be assumed that the User agrees with the Change. Notification does not apply if the Change is required by law, a court order, concerns the addition of a new service, additional features to the existing Service, or any other Change that does not reduce the User's rights or increase their obligations. In such cases, the Change will be implemented without prior notice to the User and will take effect immediately. If the User objects to the Change in the Terms within the above period, they are entitled to terminate the Agreement. In any case, the User may either accept the Change (implicitly through failure to object) or terminate the Agreement within the above period.

The User is obligated to always provide truthful, accurate, and up-to-date information as required by law. For users who only provide a nickname, this does not mean they are required to provide any additional information. This provision does not expand the scope of required personal information but emphasizes the truthfulness, accuracy, and currency of the information provided by the User.
</p>

<p class="item">
