8.
Using Disroot services for commercial activities Disroot is a non-profit organization providing services for individuals on "pay as you wish" basis.
Because of this structure we see using Disroot services for commercial purposes as an abuse of the service and it will be treated as such.
These commercial activities or purposes include, but are not limited to: Trading any Disroot services with a third party.
This is prohibited.
Using email for purposes such as "no-reply" type of accounts for a business.
If such activity is detected, the account will be blocked without a warning.
Sending bulk emails, including but not limited to marketing and advertising, for business purposes.
The account will be treated as spam and blocked upon discovery without any prior notice.
Accounts primarily used for financial gain, including but not limited to trading or managing sales, are not tolerated.
Those accounts will be subject to termination upon inquiry.
As much as we discourage using Disroot for commercial activities, we also understand that some financial activities can be part of your personal life, hobbies and passions.
As a rule of thumb, you should contact us, if your commercial use exceeds your personal use, or if you have any doubts and questions about the scope of the term "commercial activities".
Using Disroot services for other commercial activity will be examined per case and the decision on terminating such accounts will be based upon communication with the account holder and the type of the activities in question.
If you have any doubts or questions about the scope of the term "commercial activities", please contact us.

org is not responsible for any content published on any of our services.
You are responsible for your use of the Disroot's services, for any content you provide and for any consequences thereof.

11.
Laws Disroot.
org is hosted in the Netherlands and therefore is subject to Dutch laws and jurisdiction.
12.
Account termination Disroot.
org may terminate your service at any time under the following conditions: The account has been found to be sending SPAM (excessive amounts of unsolicited email).
The account has engaged in one or more of the banned activities listed above.
The above conditions are subject to change at any time.
13.
No Warranty You understand and agree that Disroot.
org provides you primarily with internet-based services.

As much as we would not like to let any of our users down, we just can not give any warranty as to the reliability, accessibility, or quality of our services.
You agree that the use of our services is at your sole and exclusive risk.
Community's Basic Coexistence Guidelines Disroot is a community, that is, a group of people who share things in common.
And the most common thing we share, besides being users of the platform, is that we are all different and therefore have particular ways of thinking, feeling and bonding.
Our terms of use govern in a general way all services.
But in those that are designed for people to interact, it is also necessary to guarantee the exercise of our differences in conditions of respect and security so that we can all express ourselves without fear of mistreatment of any kind.
To try to achieve this, we have established a series of basic conditions of coexistence.
These conditions are not intended to be perfect and monolithic, so they may change for the better.
When necessary, the community will be duly informed.
In case you consider that any of these conditions contradicts or does not fit your principles or limits in any way your way of being, you can choose not to use our instances or look for another one where you feel less conditioned.
1.
Respect if we want to be respected Insults, comments and disqualifying speech to another person or group because of their gender, social, racial, physical, mental or ideological condition are considered violent behavior and are not tolerated.
This category also includes threats and harassment.
2.
Do not contribute to abuse The distribution of material whose production process has generated violence, sexual aggression and exploitation of adults or minors is not admissible in our community.
3.
Do not promote intolerance and violence Fascism, Nazism and any other political or religious expression that promotes violence against groups of people has no place in this instance.
In case that any member of the community does not respect or intentionally violates any of the above guidelines, their account may be blocked or even deleted without notice and immediately.
4.
Taking care of our space The open and diverse nature of the Fediverse enables many ways to interact with many very different people.
And it also increases the chances of coming across bots and people who are difficult to interact with.
That's why every member of the community has moderation tools to take care of themselves and others.
These are the places where you can find moderation tools for our social services: FEDisroot D·Scribe Movim There are two levels of moderation.
Each user is responsible for blocking and/or muting accounts that they do not wish to interact with.
If the account is from an external instance, you can also send a report to the admins of that instance.
Reporting another user of the same instance is a resource to be used when someone is violating any of the Terms of use, these basic guidelines mentioned above or when the tools are not effective enough in a particular case.
The admins can intervene at any time if a case warrants it and take the appropriate measures.
Respect and care for our community is a collective responsibility of all its members.
Changes on these Terms We reserve the right to modify these conditions at any time.
We highly evaluate transparency and do our best to make sure users are notified as soon as possible about any major changes via email, social networks and/or on our blog.
Minor changes will most likely only be published on our blog.

Account expiration For safety reasons, Disroot.
org does not expire unused accounts.
This might be a subject to change if we are forced to save up disk space for other users.
Such changes in our terms will be announced via all communication channels well in advance.
We would rather appreciate people taking responsibility for their account and its impact on Disroot resources, and rather delete their account when they decide not to use our services any longer, or purge unused files.
4.
Password We never keep track of anybody who requests the activation of a Disroot account.
When creating your account, you may either choose security questions and/or adding a secondary email, both of which will allow you to recover your password in case you lose/forget it.

Impersonating or portraying another person in a confusing or deceptive manner unless the account is clearly classified as a parody.

8.
Using Disroot services for commercial activities Disroot is a non-profit organization providing services for individuals on "pay as you wish" basis.
Because of this structure we see using Disroot services for commercial purposes as an abuse of the service and it will be treated as such.
These commercial activities or purposes include, but are not limited to: Trading any Disroot services with a third party.
This is prohibited.
Using email for purposes such as "no-reply" type of accounts for a business.
If such activity is detected, the account will be blocked without a warning.
Sending bulk emails, including but not limited to marketing and advertising, for business purposes.
The account will be treated as spam and blocked upon discovery without any prior notice.
Accounts primarily used for financial gain, including but not limited to trading or managing sales, are not tolerated.
Those accounts will be subject to termination upon inquiry.
As much as we discourage using Disroot for commercial activities, we also understand that some financial activities can be part of your personal life, hobbies and passions.
As a rule of thumb, you should contact us, if your commercial use exceeds your personal use, or if you have any doubts and questions about the scope of the term "commercial activities".
Using Disroot services for other commercial activity will be examined per case and the decision on terminating such accounts will be based upon communication with the account holder and the type of the activities in question.
If you have any doubts or questions about the scope of the term "commercial activities", please contact us.

Community's Basic Coexistence Guidelines Disroot is a community, that is, a group of people who share things in common.
And the most common thing we share, besides being users of the platform, is that we are all different and therefore have particular ways of thinking, feeling and bonding.
Our terms of use govern in a general way all services.
But in those that are designed for people to interact, it is also necessary to guarantee the exercise of our differences in conditions of respect and security so that we can all express ourselves without fear of mistreatment of any kind.
To try to achieve this, we have established a series of basic conditions of coexistence.
These conditions are not intended to be perfect and monolithic, so they may change for the better.
When necessary, the community will be duly informed.
In case you consider that any of these conditions contradicts or does not fit your principles or limits in any way your way of being, you can choose not to use our instances or look for another one where you feel less conditioned.
1.
Respect if we want to be respected Insults, comments and disqualifying speech to another person or group because of their gender, social, racial, physical, mental or ideological condition are considered violent behavior and are not tolerated.
This category also includes threats and harassment.
2.
Do not contribute to abuse The distribution of material whose production process has generated violence, sexual aggression and exploitation of adults or minors is not admissible in our community.
3.
Do not promote intolerance and violence Fascism, Nazism and any other political or religious expression that promotes violence against groups of people has no place in this instance.
In case that any member of the community does not respect or intentionally violates any of the above guidelines, their account may be blocked or even deleted without notice and immediately.
4.
Taking care of our space The open and diverse nature of the Fediverse enables many ways to interact with many very different people.
And it also increases the chances of coming across bots and people who are difficult to interact with.
That's why every member of the community has moderation tools to take care of themselves and others.
These are the places where you can find moderation tools for our social services: FEDisroot D·Scribe Movim There are two levels of moderation.
Each user is responsible for blocking and/or muting accounts that they do not wish to interact with.
If the account is from an external instance, you can also send a report to the admins of that instance.
Reporting another user of the same instance is a resource to be used when someone is violating any of the Terms of use, these basic guidelines mentioned above or when the tools are not effective enough in a particular case.
The admins can intervene at any time if a case warrants it and take the appropriate measures.
Respect and care for our community is a collective responsibility of all its members.
Changes on these Terms We reserve the right to modify these conditions at any time.
We highly evaluate transparency and do our best to make sure users are notified as soon as possible about any major changes via email, social networks and/or on our blog.
Minor changes will most likely only be published on our blog.
