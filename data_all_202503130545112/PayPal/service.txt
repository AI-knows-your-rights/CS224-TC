Documents



â€¢ You waive your moral rights



Moral rights are rights to creators of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works, as well as directors of films.
"The moral rights include the right of attribution, the right to have a work published anonymously or pseudonymously, and the right to the integrity of the work. The preserving of the integrity of the work allows the author to object to alteration, distortion, or mutilation of the work that is "prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation". Anything else that may detract from the artist's relationship with the work even after it leaves the artist's possession or ownership may bring these moral rights into play. Moral rights are distinct from any economic rights tied to copyrights. Even if an artist has assigned his or her copyright rights to a work to a third party, he or she still maintains the moral rights to the work." -Wikipedia
In general, any terms that use the exact words "moral rights" as rights that are waived will fall under this Case.
â€¢ This service still tracks you even if you opted out from tracking



Users canâ€™t fully opt out of tracking technologies used for non essential purposes such as advertising, marketing or analytics.

â€¢ Your profile is combined across various products



When using multiple services from one same company, they can combine these (unrelated) information sources about you to build up a single richer user profile about you.
â€¢ You waive your right to a class action.



The right to be represented in a class action (or representative action) exists in the US and some European countries. It allows people who have been similarly injured by the same accused to take legal action by a single lawsuit instead of individually. Some Terms of Service try to limit that right. By agreeing to them, you could waive (= renounce to) your right to a class action, which might reduce your chances to be successful in a case.
