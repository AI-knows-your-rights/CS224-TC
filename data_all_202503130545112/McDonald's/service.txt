Documents



â€¢ This service holds onto content that you've deleted



Content may remain in backup servers and be retained after deletion, and thus never be completely deleted. This case doesn't apply to contributions that can't be removed due to the nature of the service.
â€¢ This service may collect, use, and share location data

The service may use tracking technologies in third-party websites to track your online activity while you aren't visiting their Site.
â€¢ The service may sell your data



There is a form to opt-out (typically California's CCPA) of the selling of your personal data. This is a bad a point because there are many services that don't have this form due to not selling your data in the first place.

It allows people who have been similarly injured by the same accused to take legal action by a single lawsuit instead of individually. Some Terms of Service try to limit that right. By agreeing to them, you could waive (= renounce to) your right to a class action, which might reduce your chances to be successful in a case.
â€¢ This service forces users into binding arbitration in the case of disputes



This service forces users to use their own contracted arbitrator and forces users to waive their rights to jury trial.
