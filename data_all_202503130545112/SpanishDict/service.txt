Some services store data on you even if you did not provide that data yourself. For example, users might provide access to their address book, after which a service might also store the phone numbers of that person's contacts.
â€¢ Logs are kept for an undefined period of time



Logs are text files containing some information about web visitors, such as user agents (showing for instance that you're connecting from Firefox for Android) and ip addresses (which reveal your approximate location). This case applies to Services that may keep logs indefinitely, allowing user sessions to be tracked over time. Logs that are kept for a time "consistent with applicable law" also fall under this case, since this period of time may be murky or undefined.
â€¢ This service may collect, use, and share location data

Tracking technologies (such as web beacons, tracking pixels...) are employed on users and/or the service assigns a unique ID to a browser or device to track its behaviour.

By agreeing to them, you could waive (= renounce to) your right to a class action, which might reduce your chances to be successful in a case.
â€¢ The court of law governing the terms is in a jurisdiction that is less friendly to user privacy protection (Virginia, USA)
