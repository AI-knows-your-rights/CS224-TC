Brave Websites, Forums, and Email Privacy Policy

) use personal data to operate its websites, forums, communications and the Brave Merch Store.
To learn how we use data for the Brave Browser, see the Brave Browser Privacy Policy.
To learn how we use data for publishers and creators, see the Publisher Privacy Policy.

Fastly’s infrastructure is designed to be as close to you as possible — probably in the same country as you, though this is not guaranteed.
The rest of this infrastructure is located in the United States, which is where information is processed and stored only for as long as necessary in order to provide services to you and support Brave in doing so.
We take a range of technical and organisational measures to safeguard any personal data processed including the use of EU standard contractual clauses.
Wherever possible we try not to process personal data.
See data processing details.

Use of our forums is subject not only to Brave’s privacy policy but also that of Discourse.
In a nutshell, your personal data will be used to operate and improve the forum and to provide customer service and support.
Please do read the privacy policies.
