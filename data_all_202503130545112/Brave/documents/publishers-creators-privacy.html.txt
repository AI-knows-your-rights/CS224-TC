Publishers & Creators Privacy Policy



Read this document to learn how we use data for publishers and content creators.
In this policy “we”, “us”, etc.
refers to Brave Software Inc.
(To learn how we use data to operate this website and other Brave sites, forums, and communications, see the Website Privacy Policy.
To learn how we use data for the Brave Browser, see the Brave Browser Privacy Policy).
Basic Attention Token Contributions To collect Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) as a creator, you must create a Brave Creators account on this site.
This involves providing your name and email address.
You will only be eligible to receive contributions from users in your capacity as a Brave creator if you have signed up with Brave Creators and meet all eligibility criteria to count as a “Verified Creator”.
Learn more about being a Verified Creator.
Brave does not know which users made contributions to which creators.
Registering sites or channels If you are a creator who has user-generated content platform accounts (including but not limited to YouTube, Twitch, Vimeo, X (formerly Twitter)/X, etc.
) or owns a website, Brave has a function that allows you to register your account or website with Brave Creators in order to receive contributions of BAT from Brave itself and/or from your visitors.
To do so, it is necessary to demonstrate that you are the owner of the site(s) or channel(s) for which you receive BAT.
For websites, this is done by providing information from your web server or DNS provider.
For user-generated content platform accounts, we will verify your ownership using services provided by the platform that hosts your channel.
For example, in order to register a YouTube channel with your Brave Creators account, Brave will use YouTube’s Application Programming Interface (API) to authenticate your account and check your ownership of the channel.
We do this check once and will save the following information: the channel’s title and description; a thumbnail picture of the channel; the current subscriber count; your YouTube User ID and User Name; your YouTube email address.
Please note that linking your YouTube account with Brave Creators is subject to YouTube’s Terms of Service and Google’s Privacy Policy (http://www.
google.
com/policies/privacy), which you would have already agreed to when creating a YouTube account.
During the process of linking your YouTube channel, you will be guided to sign in to your Google account and provided with notice about what data is shared with Brave.
You can also check what API’s have access to your data and revoke any of concern by visiting https://myaccount.
google.
com/security.
Connecting External Accounts or Addresses to Brave Creators Custodial Accounts You have the ability to connect an account from one of our custodial account provider partners (e.
g.
, Uphold, Gemini, bitFlyer, etc.
) to your Brave Creators account.
If you choose to do so, your selected account provider will tell us whether your account is in good standing, has completed certain requirements (such as ID verification or KYC requirements), the list of currencies you have configured, and the country associated with your account.
Note that our custodial account provider partners are third-party services, and in using them, you are bound by their respective Privacy Policies, Terms, and other notices.
Web3 Accounts & Addresses You have the ability to connect a self-custody Web3 address (e.
g.
, a Solana address, Ethereum address, etc.
) to your Brave Creators account and sites/channels in order to receive Brave Creators payouts from Brave, and/or to receive contributions directly from users.
Web3 addresses connected to your sites/channels will be exposed to the public so that people can send contributions directly to the Web3 addresses associated with your sites/channels.
You can remove Web3 addresses from your sites/channels or Brave Creators account at any time.
If you remove a Web3 address from a site/channel, then we will stop exposing your Web3 address to users in association with your site/channel.
Note that Web3 addresses and their associated data (such as transaction history, activity, etc.
) are typically public, immutable, and unencrypted.
Brave does not have control over Web3 networks such as Solana, Ethereum, etc.
Security We record IP addresses when requests are made to identify & prevent fraud and to protect the integrity of the service.
We also monitor how the account is used, for anti fraud and to maintain the reliability and performance of the service.
We will also check the email address you provide against https://haveibeenpwned.
com/ to determine if it has been compromised to help protect against fraud.
We rely on legitimate interests to conduct this check.
E-mail If you ask us to keep in touch with you by email, we will use SendGrid or MailChimp based in the United States to help us contact you.
The processing of personal data on our behalf is subject to a range of measures to help safeguard your personal data including the use of EU standard contractual clauses.
