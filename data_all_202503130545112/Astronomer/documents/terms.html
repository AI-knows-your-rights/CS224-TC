<h2 id="8-payment-of-fees"><strong>8. PAYMENT OF FEES</strong></h2>
<p><strong>8.1. Fees.</strong> Customer shall pay Astronomer the fees set forth in the Order Form pursuant to the payment terms contained therein. With respect to Order Form(s) entered into directly between Customer and Astronomer, except as otherwise specified in such Order Form(s): (a) all Fees owed to Astronomer will be paid in U.S. Dollars; (b) Fees for all prepaid committed Astronomer services will be invoiced in full upon execution of the applicable Order Form; and (c) all fees due in accordance with the Order Form for usage in excess of the Consumption Limits will be invoiced monthly in arrears. To the extent that Customers enters into an order with a third party reseller or accepts an order via a third party cloud service providerâs marketplace, Customer payment terms will be as separately arranged with such third party, provided that if Customer fails to pay Fees to such third party when due, Astronomer may seek direct payment from Customer, in addition to exercising its rights for non-payment in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>8.1.1. Credit Card Payments.</strong> Where applicable, Astronomer may utilize third party payment providers to process credit card payments (â<strong>Payment Provider</strong>â). Such Payment Providerâs policies govern the processing of Customerâs payment, and Customer must refer to those policies to determine its rights and liabilities. By providing credit card information to the Payment Provider, Customer authorize Astronomer, through such Payment Provider, to immediately charge the Fees, when due, for Customerâs use of the Solution during any applicable Subscription Term and for the Professional Services. Customerâs failure to maintain its current credit card information or other alternative payment method may result in an interruption of Customerâs use of the Solution.</p>
<p><strong>8.2. Non-Payment.</strong> Invoices not paid by the due date (unless disputed in good faith by the Customer in accordance with this section) are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law (whichever is lower), provided that Astronomer has first notified Customer in writing that such invoice is overdue and Customer fails to make payment in full of such invoice within fifteen (15) days following receipt of Astronomerâs written notice.</p>
<p><strong>8.3. Invoice Disputes.</strong> If Customer has a reasonably good faith dispute, Customer shall notify Astronomerâs support department at <a href="mailto:support@astronomer.io">support@astronomer.io</a> within ten (10) days of the invoice date.</p>

Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchase, receipt, access and use of the Solution and Professional Services.

Taxes will not be deducted from payments to Astronomer, except as required by applicable law, in which case Customer will increase the amount payable as necessary so that, after making all required deductions and withholdings, Astronomer receives and retains (free from any liability for Taxes) an amount equal to the amount it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made. Upon Astronomerâs request, Customer will provide to Astronomer its proof of withholding tax remittance to the respective tax authority. Where applicable, Customer will provide its VAT/GST Registration Number(s) on the Order Form to confirm the business use of the ordered services.</p>
