<li style="text-align: justify;">Recruitment partners. We may share your Personal Information with:
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Third-party service providers such as our recruitment vendor, who use it only in accordance with our instructions and as required by law.</li>

Our recruitment vendor’s Privacy Notice in respect of their use of the Disposition Data is available on their website.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Where you have applied to a job opening through another service provider, we may disclose data similar to the Disposition Data defined above to such service provider. The service provider shall be the data controller of this data and shall therefore be responsible for complying with all applicable law in respect of the use of that data following its transfer by us.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Social media partners. Kahoot! may cooperate with social media channels to promote our Services, both on our Websites and third-party websites. Notwithstanding the above, we never share information about Children for the purposes or with the parties described in this section.</li>

Any competent law enforcement body, regulatory body, government agency, court or other third-party where we believe disclosure is necessary (a) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, or by order of a competent court, (b) to exercise, establish, or defend our legal rights, or (c) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A potential buyer (and its agents and advisors) in the case of a sale, merger, consolidation, liquidation, reorganization, or acquisition.

<li style="text-align: justify;">Professional advisors. Accountants, auditors, consultants, lawyers and other outside professional advisors to Kahoot!, subject to binding contractual obligations of confidentiality.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Any other person with your consent, or where required by applicable law or court order, or for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Any relevant third-party provider, where our Websites use third-party plugins or content. If you choose to interact with any such plugins or content, your Personal Information may be shared with the relevant third-party provider. We recommend that you review that third-party’s privacy policy before interacting with its plugins or content.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of the above, Kahoot! does not sell Personal Information and we will never share or sell Student Data for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>We may also share anonymized, aggregated information with selected third-parties for statistical purposes (for example, see section 2 above).</p>
<p>We are responsible for the data privacy of the service providers we may share Personal Information with. Kahoot! only uses service providers that have data protection and security standards consistent with our own. Our service providers are not permitted to use Personal Information they process on our behalf for any other purposes than as needed to carry out their work for us. We enter into written agreements with all of our service providers restricting the use of Personal Information and imposing the same level of privacy, confidentiality and information security that apply to Kahoot!.</p>
<h2 id="security">7. Our Security</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kahoot! maintains a comprehensive security program designed to protect the security, privacy, confidentiality and integrity of Personal Information within our organization. We have in place appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Information. We limit access to your Personal Information to those who have a genuine business need to know it. Those processing your information will do so only in an authorized manner and are subject to a duty of confidentiality. Our security measures include data encryption, firewalls, data use, and access limitations for our personnel and service providers, and physical access controls to our facilities. Our service providers that process payment data, maintain the applicable Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance levels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also have procedures in place to address suspected data security breaches. We will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted through any online means, therefore any transmission remains at your own risk and you are responsible for ensuring that any Personal Information that you send to us are sent securely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Details about our security program can be found in our Trust Center. If you have any questions about the security of your Personal Information, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@kahoot.com">privacy@kahoot.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="international-transfers">8. International Transfers</h2>
<p>We collect information globally and may transfer, process and store your information outside of your country of residence, to wherever we or our third-party service providers operate for the purposes identified in Section 3.1 above. This may involve countries where the data protection, privacy rights and other laws may not be as comprehensive as in your country. Whenever we transfer your information, we take steps, including preventive measures, designed to protect your Personal Information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For all international transfers, both within the Kahoot! Group or to our sub-processors, we ensure that the recipient of your Personal Information offers an adequate level of protection by entering into appropriate agreements. All international transfers to a Third Country are made based on an appropriate legal basis, including to a country who has received a finding of adequacy by the European Commission or the UK for the purposes of Article 45 of the GDPR / UK GDPR (as applicable), including the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, including the UK and Swiss extensions, or on the basis of executed standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission or the Information Commissioner’s Office (“<strong>SCCs</strong>”).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kahoot! maintains strict organizational and technical measures to protect Personal Information stored on our, and our trusted third-parties’, servers. For example, access to any Personal Information we process in order to provide the Services is limited through login credentials, multi-factor authentication, access on a need-to-know basis and restricted access to administrative accounts for the employees who require access in order to perform their duties towards you, such as providing support services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Please note that when you transfer any Personal Information directly to any Kahoot! entity established outside the UK or the EEA (as applicable), we are not responsible for that transfer of your Personal Information. We will nevertheless process your Personal Information, from the point at which we receive those data, in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You are entitled to request a copy of our SCCs using the contact details provided below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to know more about Kahoot!´s international transfers and the measures we take to keep your Personal Information safe, please reach out to us on <a href="mailto:privacy@kahoot.com">privacy@kahoot.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="retention">9. Retention of Personal Information</h2>
<p>We do not retain Personal Information longer than necessary for the purposes for which Personal Information was collected. We retain Personal Information where we have an ongoing legitimate business or legal obligation to do so. Our retention periods will vary depending on the type of data involved, but, generally, we refer to these criteria in order to determine retention period:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">1. we will retain Personal Information in a form that permits identification only for as long as:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">a. we maintain an ongoing relationship with you (e.g., where you are a user, or you are lawfully included in our mailing list and have not unsubscribed); or</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">b. your Personal Information are necessary in connection with the lawful purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, for which we have a valid legal basis (e.g., where your Personal Information are included in a contract between us and your school, and we have a legitimate interest in processing those Personal Information for the purposes of operating our business and fulfilling our obligations under that contract; or where we have a legal obligation to retain your Personal Information),</p>
<p>plus:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">2. the duration of any applicable limitation period under applicable law (i.e., any period during which any person could bring a legal claim against us in connection with your Personal Information, or to which your Personal Information are relevant); and</p>
<p>and:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">3. in addition, if any relevant legal claims are brought, we continue to process Personal Information for such additional periods as are necessary in connection with that claim.</p>
<p>During the periods noted above, we will restrict our processing of your Personal Information to storage of, and maintaining the security of, those data, except to the extent that those data need to be reviewed in connection with any legal claim, or any obligation under applicable law.</p>
<p>Once the periods noted above in this section 9, each to the extent applicable, have concluded, we will either:</p>
<ul>
<li>permanently delete or destroy the relevant Personal Information; or</li>
<li>anonymize the relevant Personal Information.</li>
</ul>
<p>We generally retain candidate Personal Information for 24 months.</p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, it will be deleted or anonymized as soon as possible and in accordance with applicable law.</p>

<p>Subject to your consent where required by applicable law, we collect, process, and disclose Sensitive Personal Information for purposes of providing goods or services as requested; ensuring safety, security, and integrity; countering wrongful or unlawful actions; performing services for our business, including maintaining and servicing accounts, providing customer service, processing or fulfilling orders and transactions, verifying customer information, providing analytic services, and providing storage; activities relating to quality and safety control or product improvement; and other collection and processing that is not for the purpose of inferring characteristics about an individual. We do not use Sensitive Personal Information beyond these purposes.</p>
<p><u>Rights and Requests</u></p>
<p>You may, subject to applicable law, make the following requests:</p>
<ol>
<li>To know whether we process your Personal Information and to access such Personal Information. If you are a California resident, you may also request the following:
<ol>
<li>The categories of Personal Information we collected about you and the categories of sources from which we collected such Personal Information;</li>
<li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting Personal Information about you; and</li>
<li>The categories of Personal Information about you that we disclosed and the categories of third-parties to whom we disclosed such Personal Information.</li>

<p>To make a request, please contact us at privacy@kahoot.com. We will verify and respond to your request consistent with applicable law, taking into account the type and sensitivity of the Personal Information subject to the request. We may decline to honor your request where an exception applies. We may need to request your registered email address, user nickname, and/or recent login activity, in order to verify your identity and protect against fraudulent requests. If you maintain a password-protected account with us, we may verify your identity through our existing authentication practices for your account and require you to re-authenticate yourself before disclosing or deleting your Personal Information. If you make a request to delete, we may ask you to confirm your request before we delete your Personal Information.</p>
<p>When offering Services to its users, Kahoot! may act as a “service provider” or “processor,” and we collect consumer Personal Information on behalf of our users in order to provide the Service. If applicable, please direct any requests for access, correction, or deletion of your Personal Information to the user with whom you have a direct relationship.</p>
<p><strong>We do not sell Personal Information (including Sensitive Personal Information), and we do not “share” or otherwise process Personal Information (including Sensitive Personal Information) for purposes of cross-context behavioral or targeted advertising, as defined under applicable law.</strong> We have not engaged in such activities in the 12 months preceding the date this Privacy Notice was last modified. Without limiting the foregoing, we do not sell or “share” Personal Information (including Sensitive Personal Information) of minors under 16 years of age.</p>
<p><u>Appeal Process</u></p>
<p>If you are a Colorado, Connecticut, or Virginia consumer, and we refuse to take action on your request, you may appeal our refusal within a reasonable period after you have received notice of the refusal. You may file an appeal by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@kahoot.com">privacy@kahoot.com</a>.</p>
<p><u>Authorized Agents</u></p>
<p>If an agent would like to make a request on your behalf as permitted under applicable law, the agent may use the submission methods noted in the section entitled “Rights and Requests.” We will process the agent’s request consistent with applicable law. As part of our verification process, we may request that the agent provide, as applicable, proof concerning their status as an authorized agent. In addition, we may require that you verify your identity as described in the section entitled “Rights and Requests” or confirm that you provided the agent permission to submit the request.</p>
<p><u>De-Identified Information</u></p>
<p>Where we maintain or use de-identified information, we will continue to maintain and use the de-identified information only in a de-identified fashion and will not attempt to re-identify the information. <u>Compliance with FERPA, COPPA, SOPIPA and similar education privacy laws</u></p>
<p>We comply with FERPA, COPPA, SOPIPA and similar laws when applicable to our relationship with our school or school district customer. When FERPA applies, we act as a “school official” to our customer, which means that we are under the direct control of the school or district and use Student Data to provide our Services to the school or district, as set forth in our agreement with it. To the extent COPPA applies, our school or district customer provides us with any necessary consent on behalf of students’ parents or guardians to permit use of Kahoot! in the classroom.</p>
<h2 id="do-not-track">11. Do Not Track</h2>

<h2 id="changes-to-notice">12. Changes to this Notice</h2>
<p>We may change this Privacy Notice at any time and from time to time.

You can always delete your account and stop using our Services if you do not accept the change.</p>
<h2 id="children-collection">13. Our collection of Personal Information from Children</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When a Child creates an account, we collect his or her email address only for the purpose of providing password reminders to him or her, but we do not collect any other Personal Information. We immediately and permanently alter the email address such that it can only be used as a password reminder and cannot be reconstructed into its original form or used to contact the Child. We may collect certain Personal Information from Children through our products for teachers/schools, but we do so only at their direction in our capacity as a processor. When a parent creates a profile for a Child within the parent’s account, we process the Child’s first name only.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We also collect a username and password from Child account holders, which are used for login purposes only, to permit the Child account holder to use the Services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We and our service providers also collect the information described above, under “information we collect automatically,” from Children.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are a parent or guardian, you may review the information we have collected from your Child or ask us to make no further use of, or delete, such information. In your request, please include your name and your Child’s Kahoot! username, and specify the action you would like us to take. For your Child’s protection, we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request.
