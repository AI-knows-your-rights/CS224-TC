Normally any information we receive is provided on a voluntary basis.
Obligatory fields are only marked as such if the information is required in order to fulfil our statutory duty or to deal with your request or enquiry.
These data are erased when the statutory retention period expires at the latest.



c) Data stored for the purpose of sending the newsletter

d) Data stored for the purpose of web analysis



If you access the Federal Administration’s web pages and web services, the following data will be stored in log files: the IP address, date, time, browser request and the information transmitted relating to the device used, including the operating system and browser.

Web analysis tools: The Federal Administration uses the Matomo software solution as standard for web analysis not related to specific persons.

The Federal Chancellery also operates a Matomo server.
A managed server at Metanet (Schweiz) AG is used.

The data obtained is used exclusively for web analysis; they are not shared or combined with other data records.



Some federal offices use other tools for web analysis, such as Siteimprove.
The data processing is carried out in other European countries in accordance with the GDPR (Privacy Policy: Siteimprove Services).
