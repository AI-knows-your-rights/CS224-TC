For Parents, Guardians, and Other AdultsTikTok Inc.
(“TikTok”, “we” or “us”) is committed to protecting the privacy of children.
This Children’s Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and otherwise process the personal information of users under the age of 13 (“Children”) on a separate experience of the TikTok services for Children in the United States (“Kids Mode”).
Kids Mode is designed for Children residing in the United States.
It allows Children to engage with TikTok’s fun video features while limiting the information collected from them.
Children can view videos from other creators and explore their creativity by capturing their own videos with music and special effects.
While Children may save these videos directly to their device, the videos will not be collected by us or viewable by other users.
Children also have a more limited interactive experience, including, for example, they cannot exchange messages with other users, and other users cannot view their profiles.
What Information We Collect from ChildrenWhen a Child registers for TikTok, we collect only limited information, including username, password, and birthday.
We may also collect certain information automatically from the Child’s device, including internet or other network activity information such as device ID, IP address, web browser type and version, country-level location, as well as certain app activity information, such as video watches, time in the app, and general usage information.
If a Child reaches out to us via the in-app feedback form, we collect the email address that the Child provides solely for the purpose of responding to the inquiry.
While certain information we collect from children and subsequently use and disclose may constitute sensitive personal information under applicable state privacy laws, we only process such information in order to provide the Platform and within other exemptions under applicable law.
How We Use Children’s InformationWe use the information we collect to provide and support our services.
For example, we use username and password to authenticate Children.
We may use the information that is collected automatically to provide personalized content; serve contextual advertising; perform analytics and troubleshoot; protect the security and integrity of the user and our services; and ensure legal and regulatory compliance.
Children cannot publicly share personal information, including videos or profile information.
We do not engage in profiling which results in legal or similarly significant effects, as defined under applicable law.
How We Share Children’s InformationWe may share the information that we collect with our corporate group or service providers as necessary for them to support the internal operations of the TikTok service.
We may disclose personal information if permitted or required by law (i) in response to a court order or a subpoena, or similar legal process; (ii) in response to a law enforcement or public agency’s (including schools or children services) request; (iii) if we believe disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, to facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of Children using our sites or applications; (iv) to protect the security and integrity of our sites, applications, and other technology, as well as the technology of our service providers; or (v) to enable us to take precautions against liability.
TikTok does not sell information from Children to third parties and does not share such information with third parties for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising.
Data Security and RetentionWe make efforts to treat Children’s information securely and in accordance with this policy.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
Although we take steps to protect this information, we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted through the TikTok services; any transmission is at the user’s own risk.
We employ technical and organizational measures designed to achieve a level of security appropriate to risks of varying likelihood and severity and that takes into the account the rights and freedoms of users.
We maintain these technical and organizational measures and will amend them from time to time to maintain or improve the overall security of our systems.
We retain Children’s information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which the information was collected.
The retention periods are different depending on different criteria, such as the type of information and the purposes for which we use the information.

For Parents, Guardians, and Other AdultsTikTok Inc.
(“TikTok”, “we” or “us”) is committed to protecting the privacy of children.
This Children’s Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and otherwise process the personal information of users under the age of 13 (“Children”) on a separate experience of the TikTok services for Children in the United States (“Kids Mode”).
Kids Mode is designed for Children residing in the United States.
It allows Children to engage with TikTok’s fun video features while limiting the information collected from them.
Children can view videos from other creators and explore their creativity by capturing their own videos with music and special effects.
While Children may save these videos directly to their device, the videos will not be collected by us or viewable by other users.
Children also have a more limited interactive experience, including, for example, they cannot exchange messages with other users, and other users cannot view their profiles.
What Information We Collect from ChildrenWhen a Child registers for TikTok, we collect only limited information, including username, password, and birthday.
We may also collect certain information automatically from the Child’s device, including internet or other network activity information such as device ID, IP address, web browser type and version, country-level location, as well as certain app activity information, such as video watches, time in the app, and general usage information.
If a Child reaches out to us via the in-app feedback form, we collect the email address that the Child provides solely for the purpose of responding to the inquiry.
While certain information we collect from children and subsequently use and disclose may constitute sensitive personal information under applicable state privacy laws, we only process such information in order to provide the Platform and within other exemptions under applicable law.
How We Use Children’s InformationWe use the information we collect to provide and support our services.
For example, we use username and password to authenticate Children.
We may use the information that is collected automatically to provide personalized content; serve contextual advertising; perform analytics and troubleshoot; protect the security and integrity of the user and our services; and ensure legal and regulatory compliance.
Children cannot publicly share personal information, including videos or profile information.
We do not engage in profiling which results in legal or similarly significant effects, as defined under applicable law.
How We Share Children’s InformationWe may share the information that we collect with our corporate group or service providers as necessary for them to support the internal operations of the TikTok service.
We may disclose personal information if permitted or required by law (i) in response to a court order or a subpoena, or similar legal process; (ii) in response to a law enforcement or public agency’s (including schools or children services) request; (iii) if we believe disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, to facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of Children using our sites or applications; (iv) to protect the security and integrity of our sites, applications, and other technology, as well as the technology of our service providers; or (v) to enable us to take precautions against liability.
TikTok does not sell information from Children to third parties and does not share such information with third parties for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising.
Data Security and RetentionWe make efforts to treat Children’s information securely and in accordance with this policy.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
Although we take steps to protect this information, we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted through the TikTok services; any transmission is at the user’s own risk.
We employ technical and organizational measures designed to achieve a level of security appropriate to risks of varying likelihood and severity and that takes into the account the rights and freedoms of users.
We maintain these technical and organizational measures and will amend them from time to time to maintain or improve the overall security of our systems.
We retain Children’s information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which the information was collected.
The retention periods are different depending on different criteria, such as the type of information and the purposes for which we use the information.
