Documents



â€¢ Specific content can be deleted without reason and may be removed without prior notice



This service can delete specific content. Usually they will claim they reserve the right to do it at their sole discretion, which is legalese for saying they won't give a specific reason. If the terms say they will not notify you, it shall be included in the quote but if it does not explicitly say they will give you a notice, it can be reasonably inferred that they can do it without telling you.
â€¢ Logs are kept for an undefined period of time



Logs are text files containing some information about web visitors, such as user agents (showing for instance that you're connecting from Firefox for Android) and ip addresses (which reveal your approximate location). This case applies to Services that may keep logs indefinitely, allowing user sessions to be tracked over time. Logs that are kept for a time "consistent with applicable law" also fall under this case, since this period of time may be murky or undefined.
â€¢ You must provide your identifiable information



The Service requires users to provide their identifiable information, including phone number, iD number or other information, even though this data collection isnâ€™t essential for the purposes of the service. They may still allow pseudonyms in the foreground.
â€¢ This service may collect, use, and share location data



Location-based information is collected and may be used and/or shared with third parties for purposes not directly related to the services provided (i.e. the Service doesn't rely on the use or share of location data to function properly).
â€¢ Some personal data may be kept for business interests or legal obligations



After the end of the data retention period and/or if you request the deletion of your data, they may still keep it for business interests (fraud detection, transactions...) or legal obligations (tax, legal reporting...)
â€¢ Your account can be deleted without prior notice and without a reason



At any time, your account can be terminated without explanation and without warning by the service.
â€¢ Your content can be licensed to third parties



By posting content through the Services, users grant them a transferable and/or sublicensable right, which allows user content to be licensed to third parties.
â€¢ Your personal data may be sold or otherwise transferred as part of a bankruptcy proceeding or other type of financial transaction



If the service gets acquired or is involved in a merger, bankruptcy, reorganisation or sale, your personal data may be transferred or sold.
â€¢ You are tracked via web beacons, tracking pixels, browser fingerprinting, and/or device fingerprinting



Tracking technologies (such as web beacons, tracking pixels...) are employed on users and/or the service assigns a unique ID to a browser or device to track its behaviour.
â€¢ You are forced into binding arbitration or small claims court in case of disputes



This service forces users to use their own contracted arbitrator and forces users to waive their rights to jury trial.
â€¢ Instead of asking directly, this Service will assume your consent merely from your usage.



The Service infers your acceptance from your continued usage, instead of prompting you to read the new Terms and asking for direct consent. This doesnâ€™t apply to services that have no way to seek consent from users through their contact details or an account.
â€¢ You waive your right to a class action.



The right to be represented in a class action (or representative action) exists in the US and some European countries. It allows people who have been similarly injured by the same accused to take legal action by a single lawsuit instead of individually. Some Terms of Service try to limit that right. By agreeing to them, you could waive (= renounce to) your right to a class action, which might reduce your chances to be successful in a case.
â€¢ The service does not guarantee that software errors will be corrected



Users agree to use the service and its software as provided and accept that any errors within that software may not be corrected.
â€¢ You have a reduced time period (90 days) to take legal action against the service



If you wish to bring legal action against a service about a past incident, you may not be able to do so if the Terms you agreed to implied a limited amount of time. As a result it may be worthy to carefully read that section of the Terms to know exactly how much time you might have before your right to take legal action expires.
â€¢ This service gives your personal data to third parties involved in its operation



Your personal data is or may be given to third parties essential to the serviceâ€™s operation. This could be an external spam detection service for an internet forum.
â€¢ Your provided identifiable information is actively checked by the service



The service checks if the required identifiable information you've provided is correct, and may do so on a regular basis. The check measures could be analyzing your browser information and/or providing the identifiable information to a third-party or the authority, thus compromising your anonymity.
â€¢ This service assumes no liability for unauthorized access to your personal information
â€¢ You shall not interfere with another person's enjoyment of the service



Users are asked not to interfere with another person't enjoyment in using the service.
However, this statement is very vague and open to interpretation by the service itself.

You must provide your legal name and pseudonyms aren't allowed. This case doesn't apply to Services for which transparency regarding users identities is relevant for their purposes.
