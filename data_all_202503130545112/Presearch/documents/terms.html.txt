Dark Light About Presearch Help & Support Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Terms Of Service Last Updated: January 2025Presearch.
com ("Presearch") offers an internet search engine.
This search engine enables you to run searches, to advertise to others who run searches, or to run node software that powers the search engine.
You will need a Presearch account to participate in some of these activities, and you may also be eligible to receive rewards for some of these activities.
By using Presearch, you agree to the terms of service (the "Terms") outlined below, as well as any future revisions to the Terms.
Use of ServicesPresearch, its subsidiaries, and related organizations offer services to you provided that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of Canada or other applicable jurisdiction.
In order to access certain services, you may be required to provide current, accurate contact or other information as part of the registration process and/or continued use of Presearch services.
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password, and are responsible for all activities that occur under your account.
You agree to immediately notify Presearch of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security.
Presearch cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to provide us with accurate information or to keep your password secure.
ConductYou understand that all information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages or other materials ("Content") are the sole responsibility of the person from which such Content originated.
Presearch reserves the right, but shall have no obligation, to pre-screen, flag, filter, refuse, modify or move any Content available via Presearch services.
You understand that by using Presearch services you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and that you use Presearch services at your own risk.
You agree that you are responsible for your own conduct and any Content that you create, transmit, or display while using Presearch services and for any consequences thereof.
You agree to use Presearch services only for purposes that are legal, proper, and in accordance with the Terms and any applicable policies or guidelines.
You agree that you will not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts Presearch services or servers or networks connected to Presearch services.
Fraud and AbusePresearch may offer Members rewards for using the service, namely, Presearch Tokens ("PRE"), in exchange for beneficial activity such as searching, referring new users, engaging with content, long-term engagement on the platform, providing server capacity, or choosing specific paid search resources, among other possible reasons.
As such, these incentive mechanisms are potentially subject to attempted fraud and abuse, and therefore, to protect the project and its Members, fraud or abuse of any sort will absolutely not be tolerated.
In the event that Presearch detects fraud or abuse on your part, we reserve the right to terminate your account and/or cancel any rewards provided.
Additionally, we may take steps to further prevent you from using the service, and we also reserve the right to prosecute you for fraudulent activity.
Fraud is defined as intentionally attempting to earn additional rewards that you would not earn under regular use, or to obtain or withdraw tokens to which you have not legitimately purchased or earned.
Abuse includes submission of advertisements which violate published Presearch advertising policies, modification, exploitation, or reverse engineering of Presearch software or traffic, using bots or programmatic means of accessing Presearch's website or services (except when exposed intentionally through an API as opposed to a web page), or performing any action which interferes with the normal operation and stability of the Presearch platform.
Some examples of fraud and abuse include, running automated programs or bots designed to earn rewards, doing searches more frequently than you would under normal circumstances or entering bogus or duplicate queries in an attempt to earn rewards beyond those which would typically be provided for normal search behavior, creating accounts with invalid emails or contact info, creating fake accounts or fake referrals, or creating multiple accounts to bypass account limits and restrictions.
Note that the use of traffic anonymization services (shared VPNs, TOR, cloud servers, etc.
) may also flag your account as fraudulent if other Members are also using those networks to fraudulently earn rewards.
There is an automated anti-abuse system in place that analyzes your search behavior and platform usage on an ongoing basis to determine whether you are abusing the reward system.
In the event you are determined to have violated any these Terms, any rewards you have earned may be forfeited.
Any decision by Presearch to revoke your rewards for a Terms of Service violation will be in the sole and complete discretion of Presearch.
Token TypesThe Presearch Token (PRE) is the fundamental unit of value within the Presearch platform.
PRE are pre-paid advertising credits for use on the platform.
Members can both purchase PRE and earn PRE through their contributions on the platform, as well as transfer PRE credits to and from supported public blockchains.
PRE tokens in a Member's account can be found in the following locations:PRE Wallet: The tokens in the PRE Wallet belong to the Member and are held on the Presearch platform for safekeeping.
All deposits, purchases, transfers, claimed rewards, and removed token stakes go into this wallet.
When tokens are staked, the balance of this wallet is reduced.
Staking: These tokens have been pledged to a particular purpose, and belong to the Member so long as they fulfill that purpose without violating the Terms of Service.
Staking is a mechanism enabling Members to have something at stake (“skin in the game”), since they are liable to forfeit their stake if they participate in any behavior that violates the Presearch Terms of Service.
By having something staked, this enables Presearch to have higher levels of trust in a Member, and therefore to often provide higher levels of rewards or other benefits to the Member.
If a Member violates the Terms of Service, however, then tokens staked by that Member can be revoked.
As an example, if a Member stakes PRE on a keyword advertisement and submits a malicious ad, their staked PRE may be forfeited and not recoverable.
If a node operator stakes PRE on a node, and then modifies the node software, tries to capture network data, or otherwise intentionally causes network disruptions, their staked PRE may be forfeited and not recoverable.
If a Member stakes PRE toward search staking and then is determined by our fraud detection system to have generated invalid search or referral activity, then their staked tokens may be forfeited and not recoverable.
Rewards: These tokens do not belong to the Member until the Member has claimed them on the platform and transferred them to their PRE Wallet.
Some rewards tokens (such as Usage Rewards) require obtaining a minimum rewards balance before the tokens can be claimed.
Other rewards tokens (like Node Rewards) may have no minimum balance requirement.
Token Time LocksIn order to prevent abuse and arbitrage opportunities across the Presearch network, a 24 hour lock is placed on withdrawals of any tokens that are:Unstaked: This timelock prevents a Member from staking tokens, performing a malicious act on the network, and then immediately unstaking and withdrawing their tokens before the abuse or exploit is caught.
Purchases: This timelock prevents Members from using the Presearch platform for market arbitrage opportunities versus external markets.
Reward Claims: This timelock allows fraud detection systems time to detect abuse or inappropriately-earned rewards associated with a rewards claim.
Time locks only affect withdrawals from your PRE Wallet - they do not affect your token balances or ability to immediately stake your tokens on the platform.
To withdraw tokens, though, you must always hold your unstaked, claimed, or purchased in your PRE Wallet for at least 24 hours before attempting to withdrawal them.
NOTE: There is no time lock on deposits into your PRE Wallet.
Rewards and WithdrawalsBefore a Presearch Member can use their Presearch Reward Tokens or withdraw them to the blockchain, they must first earn enough tokens to claim them and transfer them to their PRE Wallet.
Claiming of PRE Rewards tokens is subject to the following limitations:For Usage Rewards:1,000 PRE must be earned in order to claim Usage RewardsA maximum of 1,000 PRE may be claimed every 90 daysPresearch reserves the right to increase or decrease these thresholds at any timeFor Node Rewards:Any amount of PRE rewards may be claimed at any timeOnce a user has claimed their rewards tokens, they own those tokens within their PRE Wallet, at which point the member may hold them, stake them, or request a withdrawal.
Once a withdrawal request is initiated, one of two things will occur:It will be automatically approved for an immediate withdrawal by the Member to their digital wallet (i.
e.
an Ethereum wallet that supports ERC-20 tokens).
It will be put in a queue to be approved by a Presearch administrator.
This scenario may occur if the withdrawal amount is high enough to trigger a manual review, if a significant number of withdrawals across the platform have triggered a temporary manual review of all transactions, for an occasional randomized review, if there is a potential anomaly (fraud, abuse, security issue, etc.
) with the Member's account that warrants further review prior to completing the withdrawal transaction.
If a request has been issued or otherwise allowed involving a system error or malicious activity, Presearch reserves the right to block a request at the approval stage and/or rescind any staked or previously rewarded tokens.
If your request is initially denied for any reason, you will be notified by a message on the site and will be directed to contact support@presearch.
io.
You may be limited to a certain number of withdrawals in a certain period of time, or a certain number of tokens at a single time or in a period of time.
This number may change based upon your account activity, or based on the needs of the project.
If your account is left dormant for more than one year, meaning that you do not login and record a search for 365 days, Presearch will consider your account abandoned and will rescind any unclaimed Rewards tokens in your account.
This does not apply to any tokens that have been purchased from Presearch, previously claimed, staked by the Member, or transferred onto the platform from the blockchain.

About Presearch Help & Support Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy



About Presearch Help & Support Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy



Terms Of Service Last Updated: January 2025Presearch.
com ("Presearch") offers an internet search engine.
This search engine enables you to run searches, to advertise to others who run searches, or to run node software that powers the search engine.
You will need a Presearch account to participate in some of these activities, and you may also be eligible to receive rewards for some of these activities.
By using Presearch, you agree to the terms of service (the "Terms") outlined below, as well as any future revisions to the Terms.
Use of ServicesPresearch, its subsidiaries, and related organizations offer services to you provided that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of Canada or other applicable jurisdiction.
In order to access certain services, you may be required to provide current, accurate contact or other information as part of the registration process and/or continued use of Presearch services.
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password, and are responsible for all activities that occur under your account.
You agree to immediately notify Presearch of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security.
Presearch cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to provide us with accurate information or to keep your password secure.
ConductYou understand that all information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages or other materials ("Content") are the sole responsibility of the person from which such Content originated.
Presearch reserves the right, but shall have no obligation, to pre-screen, flag, filter, refuse, modify or move any Content available via Presearch services.
You understand that by using Presearch services you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and that you use Presearch services at your own risk.
You agree that you are responsible for your own conduct and any Content that you create, transmit, or display while using Presearch services and for any consequences thereof.
You agree to use Presearch services only for purposes that are legal, proper, and in accordance with the Terms and any applicable policies or guidelines.
You agree that you will not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts Presearch services or servers or networks connected to Presearch services.
Fraud and AbusePresearch may offer Members rewards for using the service, namely, Presearch Tokens ("PRE"), in exchange for beneficial activity such as searching, referring new users, engaging with content, long-term engagement on the platform, providing server capacity, or choosing specific paid search resources, among other possible reasons.
As such, these incentive mechanisms are potentially subject to attempted fraud and abuse, and therefore, to protect the project and its Members, fraud or abuse of any sort will absolutely not be tolerated.
In the event that Presearch detects fraud or abuse on your part, we reserve the right to terminate your account and/or cancel any rewards provided.
Additionally, we may take steps to further prevent you from using the service, and we also reserve the right to prosecute you for fraudulent activity.
Fraud is defined as intentionally attempting to earn additional rewards that you would not earn under regular use, or to obtain or withdraw tokens to which you have not legitimately purchased or earned.
Abuse includes submission of advertisements which violate published Presearch advertising policies, modification, exploitation, or reverse engineering of Presearch software or traffic, using bots or programmatic means of accessing Presearch's website or services (except when exposed intentionally through an API as opposed to a web page), or performing any action which interferes with the normal operation and stability of the Presearch platform.
Some examples of fraud and abuse include, running automated programs or bots designed to earn rewards, doing searches more frequently than you would under normal circumstances or entering bogus or duplicate queries in an attempt to earn rewards beyond those which would typically be provided for normal search behavior, creating accounts with invalid emails or contact info, creating fake accounts or fake referrals, or creating multiple accounts to bypass account limits and restrictions.
Note that the use of traffic anonymization services (shared VPNs, TOR, cloud servers, etc.
) may also flag your account as fraudulent if other Members are also using those networks to fraudulently earn rewards.
There is an automated anti-abuse system in place that analyzes your search behavior and platform usage on an ongoing basis to determine whether you are abusing the reward system.
In the event you are determined to have violated any these Terms, any rewards you have earned may be forfeited.
Any decision by Presearch to revoke your rewards for a Terms of Service violation will be in the sole and complete discretion of Presearch.
Token TypesThe Presearch Token (PRE) is the fundamental unit of value within the Presearch platform.
PRE are pre-paid advertising credits for use on the platform.
Members can both purchase PRE and earn PRE through their contributions on the platform, as well as transfer PRE credits to and from supported public blockchains.
PRE tokens in a Member's account can be found in the following locations:PRE Wallet: The tokens in the PRE Wallet belong to the Member and are held on the Presearch platform for safekeeping.
All deposits, purchases, transfers, claimed rewards, and removed token stakes go into this wallet.
When tokens are staked, the balance of this wallet is reduced.
Staking: These tokens have been pledged to a particular purpose, and belong to the Member so long as they fulfill that purpose without violating the Terms of Service.
Staking is a mechanism enabling Members to have something at stake (“skin in the game”), since they are liable to forfeit their stake if they participate in any behavior that violates the Presearch Terms of Service.
By having something staked, this enables Presearch to have higher levels of trust in a Member, and therefore to often provide higher levels of rewards or other benefits to the Member.
If a Member violates the Terms of Service, however, then tokens staked by that Member can be revoked.
As an example, if a Member stakes PRE on a keyword advertisement and submits a malicious ad, their staked PRE may be forfeited and not recoverable.
If a node operator stakes PRE on a node, and then modifies the node software, tries to capture network data, or otherwise intentionally causes network disruptions, their staked PRE may be forfeited and not recoverable.
If a Member stakes PRE toward search staking and then is determined by our fraud detection system to have generated invalid search or referral activity, then their staked tokens may be forfeited and not recoverable.
Rewards: These tokens do not belong to the Member until the Member has claimed them on the platform and transferred them to their PRE Wallet.
Some rewards tokens (such as Usage Rewards) require obtaining a minimum rewards balance before the tokens can be claimed.
Other rewards tokens (like Node Rewards) may have no minimum balance requirement.
Token Time LocksIn order to prevent abuse and arbitrage opportunities across the Presearch network, a 24 hour lock is placed on withdrawals of any tokens that are:Unstaked: This timelock prevents a Member from staking tokens, performing a malicious act on the network, and then immediately unstaking and withdrawing their tokens before the abuse or exploit is caught.
Purchases: This timelock prevents Members from using the Presearch platform for market arbitrage opportunities versus external markets.
Reward Claims: This timelock allows fraud detection systems time to detect abuse or inappropriately-earned rewards associated with a rewards claim.
Time locks only affect withdrawals from your PRE Wallet - they do not affect your token balances or ability to immediately stake your tokens on the platform.
To withdraw tokens, though, you must always hold your unstaked, claimed, or purchased in your PRE Wallet for at least 24 hours before attempting to withdrawal them.
NOTE: There is no time lock on deposits into your PRE Wallet.
Rewards and WithdrawalsBefore a Presearch Member can use their Presearch Reward Tokens or withdraw them to the blockchain, they must first earn enough tokens to claim them and transfer them to their PRE Wallet.
Claiming of PRE Rewards tokens is subject to the following limitations:For Usage Rewards:1,000 PRE must be earned in order to claim Usage RewardsA maximum of 1,000 PRE may be claimed every 90 daysPresearch reserves the right to increase or decrease these thresholds at any timeFor Node Rewards:Any amount of PRE rewards may be claimed at any timeOnce a user has claimed their rewards tokens, they own those tokens within their PRE Wallet, at which point the member may hold them, stake them, or request a withdrawal.
Once a withdrawal request is initiated, one of two things will occur:It will be automatically approved for an immediate withdrawal by the Member to their digital wallet (i.
e.
an Ethereum wallet that supports ERC-20 tokens).
It will be put in a queue to be approved by a Presearch administrator.
This scenario may occur if the withdrawal amount is high enough to trigger a manual review, if a significant number of withdrawals across the platform have triggered a temporary manual review of all transactions, for an occasional randomized review, if there is a potential anomaly (fraud, abuse, security issue, etc.
) with the Member's account that warrants further review prior to completing the withdrawal transaction.
If a request has been issued or otherwise allowed involving a system error or malicious activity, Presearch reserves the right to block a request at the approval stage and/or rescind any staked or previously rewarded tokens.
If your request is initially denied for any reason, you will be notified by a message on the site and will be directed to contact support@presearch.
io.
You may be limited to a certain number of withdrawals in a certain period of time, or a certain number of tokens at a single time or in a period of time.
This number may change based upon your account activity, or based on the needs of the project.
If your account is left dormant for more than one year, meaning that you do not login and record a search for 365 days, Presearch will consider your account abandoned and will rescind any unclaimed Rewards tokens in your account.
This does not apply to any tokens that have been purchased from Presearch, previously claimed, staked by the Member, or transferred onto the platform from the blockchain.
Privacy PolicyPresearch takes your privacy very seriously.
By using Presearch services, you agree to the terms of the Presearch Privacy Policy, found at https://presearch.

You agree that Presearch shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of Presearch services.

Such sponsorships may be targeted to the content of information stored on the Presearch services, queries made through Presearch services or other information.
The manner, mode and extent of sponsorships by Presearch on its services are subject to change.

By using Presearch, you agree to the terms of service (the "Terms") outlined below, as well as any future revisions to the Terms.
Use of ServicesPresearch, its subsidiaries, and related organizations offer services to you provided that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of Canada or other applicable jurisdiction.
In order to access certain services, you may be required to provide current, accurate contact or other information as part of the registration process and/or continued use of Presearch services.
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password, and are responsible for all activities that occur under your account.
You agree to immediately notify Presearch of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security.
Presearch cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to provide us with accurate information or to keep your password secure.
ConductYou understand that all information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages or other materials ("Content") are the sole responsibility of the person from which such Content originated.
Presearch reserves the right, but shall have no obligation, to pre-screen, flag, filter, refuse, modify or move any Content available via Presearch services.
You understand that by using Presearch services you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and that you use Presearch services at your own risk.
You agree that you are responsible for your own conduct and any Content that you create, transmit, or display while using Presearch services and for any consequences thereof.
You agree to use Presearch services only for purposes that are legal, proper, and in accordance with the Terms and any applicable policies or guidelines.
You agree that you will not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts Presearch services or servers or networks connected to Presearch services.
Fraud and AbusePresearch may offer Members rewards for using the service, namely, Presearch Tokens ("PRE"), in exchange for beneficial activity such as searching, referring new users, engaging with content, long-term engagement on the platform, providing server capacity, or choosing specific paid search resources, among other possible reasons.
As such, these incentive mechanisms are potentially subject to attempted fraud and abuse, and therefore, to protect the project and its Members, fraud or abuse of any sort will absolutely not be tolerated.
In the event that Presearch detects fraud or abuse on your part, we reserve the right to terminate your account and/or cancel any rewards provided.
Additionally, we may take steps to further prevent you from using the service, and we also reserve the right to prosecute you for fraudulent activity.
Fraud is defined as intentionally attempting to earn additional rewards that you would not earn under regular use, or to obtain or withdraw tokens to which you have not legitimately purchased or earned.
Abuse includes submission of advertisements which violate published Presearch advertising policies, modification, exploitation, or reverse engineering of Presearch software or traffic, using bots or programmatic means of accessing Presearch's website or services (except when exposed intentionally through an API as opposed to a web page), or performing any action which interferes with the normal operation and stability of the Presearch platform.
Some examples of fraud and abuse include, running automated programs or bots designed to earn rewards, doing searches more frequently than you would under normal circumstances or entering bogus or duplicate queries in an attempt to earn rewards beyond those which would typically be provided for normal search behavior, creating accounts with invalid emails or contact info, creating fake accounts or fake referrals, or creating multiple accounts to bypass account limits and restrictions.
Note that the use of traffic anonymization services (shared VPNs, TOR, cloud servers, etc.
) may also flag your account as fraudulent if other Members are also using those networks to fraudulently earn rewards.
There is an automated anti-abuse system in place that analyzes your search behavior and platform usage on an ongoing basis to determine whether you are abusing the reward system.
In the event you are determined to have violated any these Terms, any rewards you have earned may be forfeited.
Any decision by Presearch to revoke your rewards for a Terms of Service violation will be in the sole and complete discretion of Presearch.
Token TypesThe Presearch Token (PRE) is the fundamental unit of value within the Presearch platform.
PRE are pre-paid advertising credits for use on the platform.
Members can both purchase PRE and earn PRE through their contributions on the platform, as well as transfer PRE credits to and from supported public blockchains.
PRE tokens in a Member's account can be found in the following locations:PRE Wallet: The tokens in the PRE Wallet belong to the Member and are held on the Presearch platform for safekeeping.
All deposits, purchases, transfers, claimed rewards, and removed token stakes go into this wallet.
When tokens are staked, the balance of this wallet is reduced.
Staking: These tokens have been pledged to a particular purpose, and belong to the Member so long as they fulfill that purpose without violating the Terms of Service.
Staking is a mechanism enabling Members to have something at stake (“skin in the game”), since they are liable to forfeit their stake if they participate in any behavior that violates the Presearch Terms of Service.
By having something staked, this enables Presearch to have higher levels of trust in a Member, and therefore to often provide higher levels of rewards or other benefits to the Member.
If a Member violates the Terms of Service, however, then tokens staked by that Member can be revoked.
As an example, if a Member stakes PRE on a keyword advertisement and submits a malicious ad, their staked PRE may be forfeited and not recoverable.
If a node operator stakes PRE on a node, and then modifies the node software, tries to capture network data, or otherwise intentionally causes network disruptions, their staked PRE may be forfeited and not recoverable.
If a Member stakes PRE toward search staking and then is determined by our fraud detection system to have generated invalid search or referral activity, then their staked tokens may be forfeited and not recoverable.
Rewards: These tokens do not belong to the Member until the Member has claimed them on the platform and transferred them to their PRE Wallet.
Some rewards tokens (such as Usage Rewards) require obtaining a minimum rewards balance before the tokens can be claimed.
Other rewards tokens (like Node Rewards) may have no minimum balance requirement.
Token Time LocksIn order to prevent abuse and arbitrage opportunities across the Presearch network, a 24 hour lock is placed on withdrawals of any tokens that are:Unstaked: This timelock prevents a Member from staking tokens, performing a malicious act on the network, and then immediately unstaking and withdrawing their tokens before the abuse or exploit is caught.
Purchases: This timelock prevents Members from using the Presearch platform for market arbitrage opportunities versus external markets.
Reward Claims: This timelock allows fraud detection systems time to detect abuse or inappropriately-earned rewards associated with a rewards claim.
Time locks only affect withdrawals from your PRE Wallet - they do not affect your token balances or ability to immediately stake your tokens on the platform.
To withdraw tokens, though, you must always hold your unstaked, claimed, or purchased in your PRE Wallet for at least 24 hours before attempting to withdrawal them.
NOTE: There is no time lock on deposits into your PRE Wallet.
Rewards and WithdrawalsBefore a Presearch Member can use their Presearch Reward Tokens or withdraw them to the blockchain, they must first earn enough tokens to claim them and transfer them to their PRE Wallet.
Claiming of PRE Rewards tokens is subject to the following limitations:For Usage Rewards:1,000 PRE must be earned in order to claim Usage RewardsA maximum of 1,000 PRE may be claimed every 90 daysPresearch reserves the right to increase or decrease these thresholds at any timeFor Node Rewards:Any amount of PRE rewards may be claimed at any timeOnce a user has claimed their rewards tokens, they own those tokens within their PRE Wallet, at which point the member may hold them, stake them, or request a withdrawal.
Once a withdrawal request is initiated, one of two things will occur:It will be automatically approved for an immediate withdrawal by the Member to their digital wallet (i.
e.
an Ethereum wallet that supports ERC-20 tokens).
It will be put in a queue to be approved by a Presearch administrator.
This scenario may occur if the withdrawal amount is high enough to trigger a manual review, if a significant number of withdrawals across the platform have triggered a temporary manual review of all transactions, for an occasional randomized review, if there is a potential anomaly (fraud, abuse, security issue, etc.
) with the Member's account that warrants further review prior to completing the withdrawal transaction.
If a request has been issued or otherwise allowed involving a system error or malicious activity, Presearch reserves the right to block a request at the approval stage and/or rescind any staked or previously rewarded tokens.
If your request is initially denied for any reason, you will be notified by a message on the site and will be directed to contact support@presearch.
io.
You may be limited to a certain number of withdrawals in a certain period of time, or a certain number of tokens at a single time or in a period of time.
This number may change based upon your account activity, or based on the needs of the project.
If your account is left dormant for more than one year, meaning that you do not login and record a search for 365 days, Presearch will consider your account abandoned and will rescind any unclaimed Rewards tokens in your account.
This does not apply to any tokens that have been purchased from Presearch, previously claimed, staked by the Member, or transferred onto the platform from the blockchain.

Last Updated: January 2025



Presearch.
com ("Presearch") offers an internet search engine.
This search engine enables you to run searches, to advertise to others who run searches, or to run node software that powers the search engine.
You will need a Presearch account to participate in some of these activities, and you may also be eligible to receive rewards for some of these activities.



By using Presearch, you agree to the terms of service (the "Terms") outlined below, as well as any future revisions to the Terms.



Use of Services



Presearch, its subsidiaries, and related organizations offer services to you provided that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of Canada or other applicable jurisdiction.
In order to access certain services, you may be required to provide current, accurate contact or other information as part of the registration process and/or continued use of Presearch services.
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password, and are responsible for all activities that occur under your account.
You agree to immediately notify Presearch of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security.
Presearch cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to provide us with accurate information or to keep your password secure.



Conduct



You understand that all information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages or other materials ("Content") are the sole responsibility of the person from which such Content originated.
Presearch reserves the right, but shall have no obligation, to pre-screen, flag, filter, refuse, modify or move any Content available via Presearch services.
You understand that by using Presearch services you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and that you use Presearch services at your own risk.



You agree that you are responsible for your own conduct and any Content that you create, transmit, or display while using Presearch services and for any consequences thereof.
You agree to use Presearch services only for purposes that are legal, proper, and in accordance with the Terms and any applicable policies or guidelines.
You agree that you will not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts Presearch services or servers or networks connected to Presearch services.



Fraud and Abuse



Presearch may offer Members rewards for using the service, namely, Presearch Tokens ("PRE"), in exchange for beneficial activity such as searching, referring new users, engaging with content, long-term engagement on the platform, providing server capacity, or choosing specific paid search resources, among other possible reasons.
As such, these incentive mechanisms are potentially subject to attempted fraud and abuse, and therefore, to protect the project and its Members, fraud or abuse of any sort will absolutely not be tolerated.



In the event that Presearch detects fraud or abuse on your part, we reserve the right to terminate your account and/or cancel any rewards provided.
Additionally, we may take steps to further prevent you from using the service, and we also reserve the right to prosecute you for fraudulent activity.



Fraud is defined as intentionally attempting to earn additional rewards that you would not earn under regular use, or to obtain or withdraw tokens to which you have not legitimately purchased or earned.
Abuse includes submission of advertisements which violate published Presearch advertising policies, modification, exploitation, or reverse engineering of Presearch software or traffic, using bots or programmatic means of accessing Presearch's website or services (except when exposed intentionally through an API as opposed to a web page), or performing any action which interferes with the normal operation and stability of the Presearch platform.



Some examples of fraud and abuse include, running automated programs or bots designed to earn rewards, doing searches more frequently than you would under normal circumstances or entering bogus or duplicate queries in an attempt to earn rewards beyond those which would typically be provided for normal search behavior, creating accounts with invalid emails or contact info, creating fake accounts or fake referrals, or creating multiple accounts to bypass account limits and restrictions.
Note that the use of traffic anonymization services (shared VPNs, TOR, cloud servers, etc.
) may also flag your account as fraudulent if other Members are also using those networks to fraudulently earn rewards.
There is an automated anti-abuse system in place that analyzes your search behavior and platform usage on an ongoing basis to determine whether you are abusing the reward system.



In the event you are determined to have violated any these Terms, any rewards you have earned may be forfeited.
Any decision by Presearch to revoke your rewards for a Terms of Service violation will be in the sole and complete discretion of Presearch.



Token Types



The Presearch Token (PRE) is the fundamental unit of value within the Presearch platform.
PRE are pre-paid advertising credits for use on the platform.
Members can both purchase PRE and earn PRE through their contributions on the platform, as well as transfer PRE credits to and from supported public blockchains.



PRE tokens in a Member's account can be found in the following locations:



PRE Wallet: The tokens in the PRE Wallet belong to the Member and are held on the Presearch platform for safekeeping.
All deposits, purchases, transfers, claimed rewards, and removed token stakes go into this wallet.
When tokens are staked, the balance of this wallet is reduced.



Staking: These tokens have been pledged to a particular purpose, and belong to the Member so long as they fulfill that purpose without violating the Terms of Service.
Staking is a mechanism enabling Members to have something at stake (“skin in the game”), since they are liable to forfeit their stake if they participate in any behavior that violates the Presearch Terms of Service.
By having something staked, this enables Presearch to have higher levels of trust in a Member, and therefore to often provide higher levels of rewards or other benefits to the Member.



If a Member violates the Terms of Service, however, then tokens staked by that Member can be revoked.
As an example, if a Member stakes PRE on a keyword advertisement and submits a malicious ad, their staked PRE may be forfeited and not recoverable.
If a node operator stakes PRE on a node, and then modifies the node software, tries to capture network data, or otherwise intentionally causes network disruptions, their staked PRE may be forfeited and not recoverable.
If a Member stakes PRE toward search staking and then is determined by our fraud detection system to have generated invalid search or referral activity, then their staked tokens may be forfeited and not recoverable.



Rewards: These tokens do not belong to the Member until the Member has claimed them on the platform and transferred them to their PRE Wallet.
Some rewards tokens (such as Usage Rewards) require obtaining a minimum rewards balance before the tokens can be claimed.
Other rewards tokens (like Node Rewards) may have no minimum balance requirement.



Token Time Locks



In order to prevent abuse and arbitrage opportunities across the Presearch network, a 24 hour lock is placed on withdrawals of any tokens that are:



Unstaked: This timelock prevents a Member from staking tokens, performing a malicious act on the network, and then immediately unstaking and withdrawing their tokens before the abuse or exploit is caught.



Purchases: This timelock prevents Members from using the Presearch platform for market arbitrage opportunities versus external markets.



Reward Claims: This timelock allows fraud detection systems time to detect abuse or inappropriately-earned rewards associated with a rewards claim.



Time locks only affect withdrawals from your PRE Wallet - they do not affect your token balances or ability to immediately stake your tokens on the platform.
To withdraw tokens, though, you must always hold your unstaked, claimed, or purchased in your PRE Wallet for at least 24 hours before attempting to withdrawal them.



NOTE: There is no time lock on deposits into your PRE Wallet.



Rewards and Withdrawals



Before a Presearch Member can use their Presearch Reward Tokens or withdraw them to the blockchain, they must first earn enough tokens to claim them and transfer them to their PRE Wallet.
Claiming of PRE Rewards tokens is subject to the following limitations:



For Usage Rewards:



For Node Rewards:



Once a user has claimed their rewards tokens, they own those tokens within their PRE Wallet, at which point the member may hold them, stake them, or request a withdrawal.



Once a withdrawal request is initiated, one of two things will occur:



You may be limited to a certain number of withdrawals in a certain period of time, or a certain number of tokens at a single time or in a period of time.
This number may change based upon your account activity, or based on the needs of the project.



If your account is left dormant for more than one year, meaning that you do not login and record a search for 365 days, Presearch will consider your account abandoned and will rescind any unclaimed Rewards tokens in your account.
This does not apply to any tokens that have been purchased from Presearch, previously claimed, staked by the Member, or transferred onto the platform from the blockchain.

This scenario may occur if the withdrawal amount is high enough to trigger a manual review, if a significant number of withdrawals across the platform have triggered a temporary manual review of all transactions, for an occasional randomized review, if there is a potential anomaly (fraud, abuse, security issue, etc.) with the Member's account that warrants further review prior to completing the withdrawal transaction. If a request has been issued or otherwise allowed involving a system error or malicious activity, Presearch reserves the right to block a request at the approval stage and/or rescind any staked or previously rewarded tokens.
