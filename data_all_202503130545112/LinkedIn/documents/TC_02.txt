Do Not Track (DNT) What is DNT?
DNT is the concept that has been promoted by regulatory authorities, in particular the U.
S.
Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites.
What is a DNT signal?
Currently, various browsers (including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari) offer a DNT option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header that sends a signal to websites visited by the browser user about the user's DNT preference.
You can usually access your browser's DNT option in your browser's preferences.
Is there a DNT technology standard?
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups, Internet browsers, technology companies, and regulators to develop a DNT technology standard.
While some progress has been made on this issue, it has been slow, and to date no standard has been adopted.
Without an industry standard for DNT, users cannot know how any given company abides by a DNT signal they receive from browser headers.
LinkedIn is committed to remaining apprised of the W3C efforts to develop a DNT standard.
How does LinkedIn respond to the signal?
LinkedIn takes privacy and security very seriously and strives to put our members first in all aspects of our business.
With regard to DNT, LinkedIn currently doesn't respond to DNT signals in browsers because no DNT standard has been adopted, as noted above.
What about JavaScript buttons like Share on LinkedIn?
When someone visits websites that contain JavaScript buttons ("plugins"), like LinkedIn's Share button, we receive plugin passive impression data that we depersonalize immediately.
When members actively interact with our plugins (for example, sharing articles on LinkedIn), we keep this information to provide respective functionality and improve their, and others' LinkedIn experience.
Learn more about how we use and protect plugin data.
Does LinkedIn share members' personally identifiable information with third parties (like advertisers and ad networks)?
As the world's largest professional network, our hundreds of millions of members come to LinkedIn to connect with other members, find jobs, and be found by other members for any number of professional reasons.
LinkedIn is, inherently, a public place, and there is a lot of PII on LinkedIn that is viewable by any visitor.
In other words, third parties can find out about you from the info you share on our services.
In the DNT context, however, LinkedIn doesn't authorize the identification of LinkedIn members by third parties through advertising technologies deployed in ads that may appear on LinkedIn without separate consent.
Please note, that our Privacy Policy uses the definition of "direct marketing" provided by the California Civil Code §1798.
83, to include marketing directly to individuals by means of mail, phone, or e-mail for personal purposes.
Thank you.
