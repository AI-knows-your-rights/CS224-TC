Email: Our marketing communications are optional to receive and you can unsubscribe from the footer of the email or by updating your Mozilla email preferences, or for Thunderbird’s newsletter, on the Thunderbird website.



Analytics & Optimization: Follow the instructions below to prevent data collection about your visits to Mozilla websites:



Social Media: The social sharing buttons on Mozilla websites are designed not to share data with the applicable social media provider until you specifically click the relevant social media icon.



Some Mozilla websites allow you to make purchases (such as apps or gear), contribute funds to specific Mozilla projects, or make donations in support of Mozilla public and charitable programs.
These transactions are often handled by Mozilla’s third-party vendors.



Payment Processing: When you purchase something via a Mozilla website, contribute funds or make donations, you will send payment through one of our third-party payment providers: Stripe, Apple Pay, PayPal, Venmo or Google Pay.
Mozilla receives a record of your account (including your billing address and the last four digits of your payment method) and (where relevant) the status of your account’s subscription; we may also receive your name, mailing address, and/or email address.
This data is used for payment processing, fraud detection and record-keeping purposes.



Contact and Donation Information: We use Acoustic, Salesforce, Fundraise Up and Campaign Monitor to email receipts and store records, which are retained for 10 years from the date of last payment.
If you make a donation to the Mozilla Foundation or Thunderbird, we use Fundraise Up to manage our donations and provide transactional receipts to donors.
