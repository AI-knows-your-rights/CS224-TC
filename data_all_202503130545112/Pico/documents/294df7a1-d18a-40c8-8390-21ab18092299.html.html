Other than the Websites, this Cookies Policy does not apply to any of our services, applications, products and content, which are each subject to their own, separate, notices.<br/><br/>On the Websites, we use cookies and other tracking technologies such as software development kits (each, an &quot;<strong>SDK</strong>&quot;), application programmable interfaces (each, an &quot;<strong>API</strong>&quot;), pixels and local or session storages. These technologies allow us to store information or gain access to information stored on your device to enable certain features and distinguish you from other visitors. Tracking technologies are used by most website providers to let users navigate between pages efficiently, ensure web security, understand how their websites are used, remember user preferences and generally improve the user experience.</p><p></p><p><br/><strong>What tracking</strong> <strong>technologies are used?</strong> </p><p>The Websites use the following kinds of tracking technologies:<br/> <u>Cookies</u>: Cookies are small text files that enable us and our service providers and partners to uniquely identify your browser or device for various purposes, including those described above. Cookies normally work by assigning a unique number to your device and are stored on your browser by the websites that you visit as well as third party service providers and partners to those websites. <br/>Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are &quot;session cookies&quot;, meaning that they exist only while your browser is open and are deleted automatically once you close your browser.<br/> Other cookies are &quot;persistent cookies&quot;, meaning that they survive after your browser is closed. Most persistent cookies are set to automatically expire after a defined duration (for example, a few days, weeks or months). When you return to that website (or visit other websites that use the same cookies) the website provider or its service providers can recognise the persistent cookies they have set and recognise your browsing device.</p><p><br/> <u>Local storage</u>: Local storage files are created by apps and websites to store information locally on your device. They are very similar to cookies, but can have slightly different properties (for example, local storage can be used to store more information and can be stored in a different location on your device to cookies). Local storage is normally used to speed up app and site functionality and remember your preferences.</p><p><br/><u>Session Storage</u>. This technology is used by websites to temporarily store data on your device while you are actively using the Websites. Unlike persistent cookies or local storage, session storage data is only available during your current visit to the website. </p><p><br/><u>API</u>: An API is a piece of software which helps two or more applications to talk to one another. We use them to communicate between Pico and our service providers.</p><p><br/><u>SDK</u>: An SDK is a piece of code that enables data to be collected about your device, network and interaction with a website. Like cookies, it generally operates by assigning your device a unique number.</p><p><br/><strong>Categories of tracking</strong> <strong>technologies</strong> </p><p>The types of tracking technologies used by us and our partners in connection with the provision of the Websites can be classified into the following categories. Some of these categories are essential to provide you with the Websites and the features you have requested to work, such as to securely log into the Websites. As such, you cannot decline these tracking technologies.<br/><br/><br/>The following is a list of of the categories of tracking technologies we use:<br/><br/><br/><strong>(i) Strictly necessary</strong><br/><br/><br/>These tracking technologies are strictly necessary to provide you with the Websites and the features you have requested to work, such as to allow you to log into secure areas of the Websites. As such, you cannot decline these tracking technologies.<br/><br/><br/><em><u>First-party tracking technologies (set by Pico):</u></em><br/>We use first-party tracking technologies for the following essential purposes:<br/></p><ul><li>Optimising and improving access to the website;</li><li>Preventing fraud and detecting non-human (bot) traffic; and</li><li>User authentication and secure logins;</li></ul><p><br/><br/>Some of these first-party tracking technologies have a maximum duration of 12 months.<br/><br/><br/><em><u>Third-party tracking technologies (set by our partners):</u> ­­</em><br/>None for this purpose.<br/><br/><br/><strong>(ii) Functionality</strong> <u><strong>and Customization</strong></u><br/><br/><br/>These tracking technologies record information you enter or choices you make, such as your login details, login status, ID, language preference for the Websites and your Cookie consent choice. ­­­­­ They help to make the Websites work more efficiently and enable us to tailor the Website to your preferences. Some of these tracking technologies used may be essential for the Websites and the features you have requested to work, and as such, you cannot decline such tracking technologies.<br/><br/><br/><em><u>First-party tracking technologies (set by Pico):</u></em><br/>We use first-party tracking technologies for the following functionality purposes:<br/></p><ul><li>Localisation (remembering the country from which you visit the Website(s) and your language preferences);</li><li>Cookie consent (remembering your cookie consent preferences); and</li><li>To optimise the interface display on the device.</li></ul><p>Some of these first-party tracking technologies have a maximum duration of 12 months.<br/><br/><br/><u><em>Third-party tracking technologies (set by our partners): ­­</em></u><br/>None for this purpose.<br/><br/><br/><strong>(iii) Analytics and performance</strong><br/>We use analytics and performance tracking technologies to analyse how you use the Websites, including which pages you view most often, how you interact with the content, measure any errors that occur and test different design ideas. The information is used to report and evaluate your activities and patterns as a user of the Websites.<br/><br/><br/><u><em>First-party tracking technologies (set by Pico):</em></u><br/>We use first-party tracking technologies for analytics and web optimisation purposes. Some of these first-party tracking technologies have a maximum duration of 12 months.<br/><br/><br/><u><em>Third-party tracking Technologies (set by our partners): ­­</em></u><br/>[With respect to picoxr.com only], we deploy tracking technologies from the following third parties for the following analytics and performance purposes:<br/></p><ul><li><strong>Google Analytics</strong> (<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" data-href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>):<br/></li><ul><li>Purpose: Analyse website usage, including the number of page views and unique visitors. </li><li>Duration: 13 months </li></ul></ul><p></p><p><br/><br/><strong>(iv) Advertising and marketing</strong><br/><br/><br/>We also use third party tracking technologies for our own advertising and marketing purposes, including to serve ads about the websites on third party platforms, remarket the Websites to people who have already visited our website, and measure the performance of our advertising campaigns.<br/><br/><br/><u><em>First-party tracking technologies (set by Pico):</em></u><br/>None for this purpose.<br/><br/><br/><u><em>Third-party tracking technologies (set by our partners): ­­</em></u><br/>[With respect to picoxr.com only], we deploy tracking technologies from the following third parties for the following advertising and marketing purposes:<br/></p><ul><li><strong>Google Analytics</strong> (<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" data-href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>):<br/></li><ul><li>Purpose: Measure the effectiveness of various advertising channels</li><li>Duration: 13 months </li></ul></ul><p></p><p><strong>Do other parties use these tracking technologies on the Websites?</strong></p><p>Tracking technologies can either be “first-party” or “third-party”. First-party tracking technologies refer to tracking technologies that we set and use directly. Third-party tracking technologies refer to tracking technologies set by third parties (such as analytics service providers). <br/>We only use first-party and third-party tracking technologies on the Websites.<br/><br/><br/><strong>How can I control these tracking technologies?</strong><br/>Some of the tracking technologies that we use are strictly necessary to operate the Websites. As a result, you cannot control the use of such tracking technologies. You can choose to accept or refuse other types of tracking technologies that are not strictly necessary to provide you with the Websites. <br/><br/><br/>Blocking and/or deleting Cookies may mean that some of your Websites preferences will be lost. Blocking all Cookies may also mean certain functionalities on the Websites will not operate properly. Please note that if you choose to refuse or delete Cookies you may not be able to use the full functionalities of the Websites.<br/><br/><br/><strong><u>Website Cookie Settings Tool</u></strong><br/>You can manage your Cookie settings and accept or refuse certain Cookies on our Websites at any time via our Cookie Settings tool which you can access here: <span style="background-color:#ffffff"><a href="#cookie" data-href="#cookie" target="" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Cookie settings</a></span><br/><br/><br/><strong><u>Your Web Browser Settings</u></strong><br/>Most browsers will also allow you to choose the level of privacy settings you want.
