Your personal data is used for limited purposes Your Personal Data is only used for the essential purposes of the Service, which are clearly defined on the Agreements.
For instance, the Service won't abuse your data to deliver targeted advertisements to you or for marketing purposes.
You can retrieve an archive of your data Users can request a copy of the data collected through the services and infer from it the amount of personal information that is processed and stored by the Service.
This usually applies to Services GDPR compliants.
A list of all cookies set by the website is provided The service provides users with a complete list of all first and third party cookies its website sets and an explanation of their uses.
This information can be valuable for users to make an informed choice whether to allow those cookies.
Information is provided about how your personal data is used The Privacy Policy explains the purposes for which data is collected and the way it is processed, used and shared.
The service reviews its privacy policy on a regular basis Users know the date the privacy policy was last updated and can thus infer the next time it will be reviewed.
This gives users more certainty about how long they can trust the current policy to apply.
A complaint mechanism is provided for the handling of personal data The service provides users with contact information for an internal or external structure to lodge complaints.
It also provides users with contact information for a higher data protection / privacy office in case the internal mechanism fails to satisfy the user.
Conditions may change, but your continued acceptance is not inferred from an earlier acceptance When you're not logged in to a service, but use it repeatedly, it may still feel weird that their terms and conditions can change between one use and the next.
However, this does not violate the rule-of-thumb that each new version should be accepted from scratch, without inferring your acceptance from the acceptance of an earlier version.
Since no acceptance is inferred from continued use, but only from current use, we rate this as neutral instead of bad.
