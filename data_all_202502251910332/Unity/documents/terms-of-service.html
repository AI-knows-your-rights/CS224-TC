changed: </strong>We updated the Unity Terms of Service with a focus on clarity, mutual confidentiality, safeguarding your information, and streamlining bug submission processes across all services. Clarifications include simplified embedded software restrictions and revised guidelines regarding gambling. Additionally, the criteria for our Education Grant License (EGL) program can now be found <a href="https://unity.com/legal/egl-eligibility-criteria">here</a>. Please review the full text of the updated Terms of Service. You can view the prior version of our Terms of Service <a href="https://unity.com/legal/terms-of-service-legacy">here</a>.</p><p>These Terms apply to your account with Unity and to our Offerings and constitute a binding contract between you and the Unity Contracting Party. Capitalized terms are defined in these Terms, including in the Definitions section below.</p><h4><strong>1. Eligibility</strong></h4><p>You must be at least the age to consent to processing of your personal data in your country of residence (e.g., 13 in the US, 16 in the EU, no minimum age in AUNZ, etc.) and comply with all eligibility conditions as set forth by Unity in the Documentation for an Offering or otherwise on the Site and as verified by Unity or Unity’s third party partners to Purchase Educational Versions, including, if applicable the <a href="https://unity.com/legal/egl-eligibility-criteria">Unity Education Grant License Qualification Criteria</a>. You must be at least 18 years old to make Purchases or submit User Content to Unity. If you are under the age of 18, or under whatever is the age of legal majority where you access the Offerings, you may only Purchase (or make purchases or sales through) the Offerings with the authorization of your legal guardian, and you and your legal guardian represent and warrant that you and your legal guardian have read, understood and agreed to these Terms. You represent and warrant that: (a) you have the legal capacity to agree to the Terms; (b) you are not located in a country embargoed by the United States and that you are not on the U.S. Treasury Department&#x27;s list of Specially Designated Nationals; and (c) you will comply with all applicable laws and regulations in connection with your use of the Services (including but not limited to applicable Federal Trade Commission rules and COPPA), and in accordance with the terms and conditions specified in the Terms.</p><h4><strong>2. Acceptance</strong></h4><p>By accepting these Terms during your account registration, your Purchase process, or while using the Offerings (including access, enablement or utilization based on a “free,” “evaluation,” or “trial” basis), you accept and agree to these Terms and to be a party to this binding contract. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not Purchase or use our Offerings.</p><p>You agree to these Terms on behalf of the company or other legal entity for which you are acting (for example, as an employee or contractor) or, if you are not acting on behalf of a company or other legal entity, on behalf of yourself as an individual. <strong>“You”</strong> refers to the entity or individual that is a party to these Terms. You represent and warrant that you have the right, authority, and capacity (for example, you are of sufficient legal age) to act on behalf of and bind such entity (if any) and yourself.</p><h4><strong>3. Additional Terms; Commercial Terms</strong></h4><p>Certain Offerings are subject to additional terms (“<strong>Additional Terms</strong>”). Additional Terms are set forth in the Additional Terms page located at <a href="https://unity.com/legal/additional-terms">unity.com/legal/additional-terms</a>, which supplement and are incorporated into these Terms, or in the Documentation, Offering Identification or Policies for the Offering. You agree to the Additional Terms, if any, for an Offering that you Purchase or use.</p><p>In addition, you may have an additional agreement with a Unity entity that supplements, amends, supersedes or replaces these Terms (for example, an enterprise business agreement) (“<strong>Commercial Terms</strong>”).</p><h4><strong>4. Right of Return or Refund</strong></h4><p>All sales are final and no refunds will be allowed except as required by law.</p><h4><strong>5. Your Account</strong></h4><p>To access and/or use most Offerings, you must register for a “Unity Account”. To create a Unity Account, you will be required to provide certain information and you will either establish a username and a password or login with a Unity-approved authentication method. Your account is accessible at <a href="https://id.unity.com/">https://id.unity.com/</a> or at another site as designated by Unity. Each account is associated with one or more “Unity Organizations”, and the owner of a Unity Organization may add you to their Unity Organization, which will allow you with access to Offerings that we provide to such Unity Organization.</p><p>You are responsible for anyone who Purchases or uses Offerings through you or your Unity Account or Unity Organization, and any act or omission of any such person that is not in compliance with these Terms will constitute an act or omission by you. In certain cases, Authorized Users may be required to set up individual accounts or agree to applicable terms in order to Purchase Offerings, but you remain responsible for all activity that occurs via your Unity Account or within your Unity Organization. You are responsible for safeguarding your password, and you may not disclose your password to any third party. You will immediately notify Unity of any unauthorized use of your account or the accounts of Authorized Users.</p><p>Any information you provide to us must be accurate, current and complete, and you will update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete, and Unity may suspend or terminate your Unity Account in accordance with these Terms if any information you provide to us proves to be inaccurate, not current or incomplete.</p><p>You may close your account at any time, provided that you have paid any and all remaining amounts owed to Unity beforehand, by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@unity3d.com">support@unity3d.com</a>, by submitting a request at <a href="https://support.unity.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=65905">Support Requests</a> or by reaching out to your Unity account manager, if applicable.</p><p>Certain Offerings may require or allow you to create an additional, Offering-specific account. The terms of this Section 5 (and including any terms further set forth in the Documentation or Additional Terms for an Offering) will also apply to your creation, use and cancellation of such accounts.</p><p>If your Unity Account or any Offering-specific account is canceled, terminated or suspended, you and, if applicable, your Authorized Users, will lose the ability to access and use such Unity Account and any User Content that you have uploaded or stored using any Offering. Unity may immediately delete such User Content at the time of cancellation, termination or suspension of such Unity Account, and Unity will not be liable to you or any third party in connection with such deletion of your User Content or your loss of access and use of such Unity Account.</p><h4><strong>6. User Content</strong></h4><p>Your User Content is yours. Except as expressly granted to Unity under these Terms, you retain your ownership rights to User Content until you decide to transfer those rights.</p><h4><strong>7. Privacy</strong></h4><p>Unity’s <a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> sets forth how Unity may collect, use, store and process personal information of or relating to you, and how you may request deletion of your personal information. For clarity, this includes personal information provided to Unity as part of any User Offering Data. You acknowledge that you have read and understand the Privacy Policy. You acknowledge and agree that Unity may deliver messages and contact you about the Offerings.</p><p>If you are Purchasing or using Unity Educational Grant License, you acknowledge that you have read and understand the <a href="https://unity.com/legal/educational-products-for-schools-privacy-notice">Unity Educational Products for Schools Privacy Notice</a> (“<strong>Educational Privacy Notice</strong>”). Notwithstanding the fact that only certain of our educational Offerings may collect personal data, you represent and warrant that you (i) have the legal authority to, and do consent to, the collection of personal information of your students, and (ii) have obtained all relevant legally required consents to the limited collection of personal information from your students, in each case in connection with providing such students with access to those educational Offerings for the purposes described in the Educational Privacy Notice. Such information may be transferred outside of the European Economic Area.</p><h4><strong>8. Data</strong></h4><p><strong>8.1 Data Processing Addendum</strong></p><p>Unless these Terms explicitly state otherwise, you agree that the Data Processing Addendum applies in addition to these terms for each Offering.</p><p><strong>8.2 Reporting Data</strong></p><p>You may not disclose or transfer Reporting Data (including, anonymous, aggregated or derived data) to any third party or expose Reporting Data to the general public, in each case unless permitted under the Documentation.</p><p><strong>8.3 User Offering Data</strong></p><p>In order for you to access and use certain Offerings, or for Unity to provide you with certain services, you may provide User Offering Data to Unity. When you provide or make accessible User Offering Data to Unity, you authorize, and hereby grant the right and license to Unity and its designees to use User Offering Data to provide, develop and improve the Offerings and other Unity services and to provide support services to you hereunder, and if applicable, you will provide all notices and obtain all required consents from End Users in order to permit the foregoing. The foregoing right and license is non-exclusive, transferable (in accordance with the “Assignment” section hereof), worldwide, royalty-free and fully paid-up.</p><p><strong>8.4 End User Data</strong></p><p>With respect to any End User data resulting from your or any End User’s use of any of the Offerings, you agree that Unity may use the End User data therein (including individual player data) in accordance with applicable, the Data Processing Addendum, and its then current privacy policy. From time to time, Unity may, notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, use aggregated or de-identified End User data for research and marketing purposes and to provide, develop and improve the Offerings and other Unity services and to provide technical support services to you hereunder. You agree that Unity has the right to process, in an aggregate manner and subject to the terms of its current privacy policy, information collected in your use of the Offering, including, without limitation, data collected via the Offering on the characteristics and activities of End Users on your Projects.</p><p><strong>8.5 Personal Information</strong></p><p>Except as expressly required by Unity (for example, as set out in Additional Terms or when we require a credit card number for you to purchase a subscription), or as permitted by Unity for information uploaded through the use of an Offering, you will not upload or otherwise make available to Unity any Sensitive Personal Information, including any files containing Sensitive Personal Information, in connection with your use of any Offering. “Sensitive Personal Information” means Social Security number, credit or debit card number, financial account number, driver’s license or other governmental ID number, medical information, health insurance information, information related to race or ethnic origin, religion or other beliefs, political affiliation or opinions, genetic or biometric data, criminal background, sexual orientation, trade union membership, or any other information that may pose a risk of harm to an individual if improperly accessed, disclosed or used.</p><p>You represent and warrant that in respect of any data collected by Unity, provided by you to Unity, or to which you grant Unity access under or in connection with these Terms that constitutes “personal data” or “personal information” as defined under applicable privacy and data protection laws, that you have and will comply with such laws. Such compliance by you includes, but is not limited to, providing sufficiently clear, meaningful and prominent notices to, making all required disclosures to, and obtaining the necessary consent or permission from any individual to whom such data relates regarding the collection, disclosure, transfer, use and security of such data as required by law, applicable Terms of Service and any Additional Terms, or Data Processing Addendum. To the extent such data is biometric information, including any voice, audio, or facial features, you will obtain any necessary consents for both collection and storage of such information. Please note that Unity may request copies of your consent records to confirm your compliance with this Section. Failure to provide proper documentation may result in cancellation of your use of the Service. Further, where applicable, you give your written consent to Unity to collect, store, disclose and use any biometric information contained in Projects from which Offerings will be provided. In addition, you will at all times maintain, display and abide by a conspicuously placed privacy policy that makes appropriate disclosures to End Users, including disclosures that (i) comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations and/or any applicable requirements, terms, or guidelines required by your platform providers; (ii) explain that Usage Data can be processed as contemplated by these Terms and as set out in the Unity Privacy Policy; (iii) provide notice of your use of a tracking pixel, agent or any other visitor identification technology that collects, uses, shares and stores data about End Users, which privacy policy shall also include a link to the <a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy">Unity Privacy Policy</a>; and (iv) if applicable, explains how End Users can opt out of the Offering.</p><p><strong>8.6 Child Data Laws</strong></p><p>You will notify Unity prior to any use of the Offerings in connection with any Project that is “directed or enticing to children” under child data laws, including but not limited to COPPA, which notification must be made by appropriately designating such Project, including via, as applicable, the administration portions of the Dashboard or the Software. You represent and warrant that, in connection with (a) any application that collects or is likely to collect data of children under the age to consent to the processing of their personal information in their respective jurisdiction or is labeled or described as a “Kid’s” or “Children’s” application, or (b) any user who represents to you, such as through an age-gating mechanism, that they are under the age to consent to the processing of their personal information in their respective jurisdiction, you will not transmit to Unity any “Personal Information” as that term is defined under applicable law unless you have the authority to do so or have received a received a compliant verifiable parental consent for the collection of such information, Unity has a such a compliant solution available for the use of such information, or Unity’s use of the information is for internal operations (or equivalent in the respective jurisdiction) excepted from the consent requirement. You agree to treat the data of those under 18 in a manner which is compliant with the jurisdiction within which your Project operates.</p><h4><strong>9. Payments</strong></h4><p><strong>9.1 Fees</strong></p><p>Fees and usage rates for certain Offerings are set forth within the Offering Identification. Unity may add or change fees, rates and charges for any of the Offerings from time to time by notifying you of such changes and/or posting such changes to the Offering Identification, which may include changes posted to the Site. Unity will provide you with prior notice of any changes affecting existing Offerings you have already started using, and your continued use of any Offering after the effective date of any such change means that you accept and agree to such changes.</p><p>You agree to pay all amounts due for the Offerings in accordance with the applicable Offering Identification and, if applicable, those of any payment processor. If you fail to make all payments when due, then Unity may suspend your access to or use of any Offerings in accordance with these Terms. Unless otherwise specified in an Offering Identification or the Additional Terms, (a) all payments under these Terms will be made in U.S. Dollars and (b) if the applicable Offering requires or allows you to elect to be invoiced monthly, you will pay all amounts in full no later than thirty (30) days from the date of invoice to the bank account designated by Unity.</p><p>Payments made under these Terms will be made without deduction or set-off for any withholding taxes, levies, imports, duties, charges and fees imposed by any governmental taxing authority except as required by law. If you are required to make any such deduction, then you will pay to Unity such additional amounts as are necessary to ensure Unity&#x27;s receipt of the full amount that Unity would have received but for the deduction. You will be responsible for, and will promptly pay, all taxes, levies, imports, duties, charges and fees of any kind (including but not limited to sales, use and withholding taxes) associated with any Purchase of the Offerings, except for taxes based on Unity’s net income. In the event that Unity is required to collect any tax for which you are responsible, you will pay such tax directly to Unity or its payment processor. Unity reserves the right to collect any applicable sales, use or value added tax.</p><p>You acknowledge and agree that, in the case of certain Offerings, any estimates of fees and charges provided to you by Unity (for example, based on assumed data consumption) are solely estimates based on assumptions and that you are fully responsible for the actual fees and charges that accrue.</p><p><strong>9.2 Billing</strong></p><p>If you Purchase Offerings, then you will be asked to provide customary billing information, such as name, company name, billing address, credit card information, and VAT or GST number, either to Unity or its third party payment processor. VAT and GST numbers cannot be added or changed after the Purchase is processed. When you provide billing information to Unity or its third party payment processor, you (a) represent and warrant that you are the authorized user of the card, PIN, key or account associated with such billing information, (b) agree to pay Unity for all Purchases (including all applicable taxes) made via the Site, within the Offering or otherwise and (c) authorize Unity or its third party payment processor to charge your credit card or otherwise process your payment for any Purchase or other fees incurred by you. If you are directed to Unity’s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s privacy policy. You will review such third party’s terms and conditions and privacy policy before using such services.</p><p><strong>9.3 Subscription Term</strong></p><p>Each subscription to an Offering is for a fixed, limited term, the length of which should be indicated at the time of Purchase on your Offering Identification. At the end of your subscription term for an Offering, your subscription will automatically renew at the then-current price and terms for the Offering, unless otherwise indicated to you in the Offering Identification. If you do not cancel any such subscription before the end of the current subscription term (or free trial period), your subscription will automatically renew (or your trial subscription will automatically convert to a paid subscription) for the subscription term disclosed to you in the Offering Identification. Unity will send you a reminder notice prior to the renewal date stating the subscription fee for and the length of the renewal term, and Unity will remind you of your right to cancel your subscription, how to do so, and that your subscription will renew if you do not cancel it.

If we modify these Terms, we will post the modification on the Site or otherwise provide you with notice of the modification. We will also update the “Last updated” date at the top of these Terms. By continuing to access or use the Offerings after we have provided you with notice of a modification, you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If the modified Terms are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Services.</p><p>Notwithstanding this section, if the Additional Terms, Commercial Terms, Offering Identification, Documentation or Policies include different terms or procedures related to modification of those policies and terms, modification may, at Unity’s option, be handled as described in those policies and terms.</p><p>You acknowledge that your commitments with respect to the Offerings are not contingent on delivery of future features or functionality (or oral or written statements about future features or functionality).</p><p><strong>24.3 Language of Terms; Interpretation</strong></p><p>The English language version of these Terms will be the version used when interpreting or construing these Terms, and any notices or other communications in connection with these Terms will be provided in the English language.

Section and other headings are for ease of reference only and are not to be used to interpret the meaning of any provision. Any rights and remedies provided for in these Terms are cumulative and are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available under applicable law.</p><p><strong>24.4 Unity Party, Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</strong></p><p>The governing law of these Terms will be the substantive laws of the State of California without regard to its conflicts of law principles.</p><p>The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply.</p><p>References to “<strong>Unity Contracting Party</strong>” refer to Unity Technologies SF, unless and to the extent otherwise set forth in an Offering Identification or any Commercial Terms.</p><p>The parties are entering into these Terms as principal and not as agent of any person or entity. Nothing in these Terms shall constitute or be deemed to constitute any party as the agent or employee of the other party or any other person or entity for any purpose whatsoever. No party has the authority or power to bind the other party or any other person or entity, or to contract in the name of, or create a liability against, the other party or any other person or entity.</p><p><strong>If your place of residency or principal place of business is in the United States:</strong></p><p>Notwithstanding the choice of substantive law clause above, the parties agree that this contract concerns interstate commerce and that arbitration and this agreement to arbitrate will be governed by Title 9 (Arbitration) of the United States Code.</p><p>Except for disputes falling within the Arbitration Exceptions set out below, any dispute arising out of, relating to or in connection with these Terms (including any disputes regarding the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or termination thereof or any dispute regarding non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating to be) will be referred to and finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) under the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules. The seat of arbitration will be the City and County of San Francisco, California. The number of arbitrators will be three with the claimant party nominating one arbitrator, the respondent party nominating one arbitrator and the third and presiding arbitrator being nominated by the two party appointed arbitrators within 30 days of the appointment of the second arbitrator. The language of arbitration will be English. Except in respect of disputes falling within the Arbitration Exceptions set out below, the parties agree that they are each waiving the right to a trial by jury. The arbitration award will be final and binding on the parties. Judgment upon the award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction of the award or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets.</p><p>The Parties agree that any arbitration will be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the Parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND UNITY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If there is a determination that any term in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason as to any claim, then the arbitration provision set forth above will be inapplicable as to that claim, and that claim will instead proceed through litigation in court rather than by arbitration, but only after the conclusion of the arbitration of any claim or dispute subject to the parties’ arbitration agreement.</p><p><strong>If your place of residency or principal place of business is outside the United States:</strong></p><p>References to the governing law refer
