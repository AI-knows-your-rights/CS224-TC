<p>Last updated on: March 1, 2023</p><p>Welcome to Shopify! By signing up for a Shopify Account (as defined in
Section 1) or by using any Shopify Services (as defined below), you
are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions (the
“<strong>Terms of Service</strong>”).</p><p>As used in these Terms of Service, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, “<strong>our</strong>” and
“<strong>Shopify</strong>” means the applicable Shopify Contracting Party (as
defined in Section 13 below), and “<strong>you</strong>” means the Shopify User (if
registering for or using a Shopify Service as an individual), or the
business employing the Shopify User (if registering for or using a
Shopify Service as a business)
and any of its affiliates.</p><p>Shopify provides a complete commerce platform that enables merchants to
unify their commerce activities. Among other features, this platform
includes a range of tools for merchants to build and customize online
stores, sell in multiple places (including web, mobile, social media,
online marketplaces and other online locations (“<strong>Online Services</strong>”) and
in person (“<strong>POS Services</strong>”)), manage products, inventory, payments,
fulfillment, shipping, business operations, marketing and advertising,
and engage with existing and potential customers. Any such service or
services offered by Shopify are referred to in these Terms of Services
as the “<strong>Service(s)</strong>”. Any new features or tools which are added to
the current Services will also be subject to the Terms of Service.
You can review the current version of the Terms of Service at any
time at <a href="https://shopify.com/legal/terms">https://shopify.com/legal/terms</a>.</p><p>You must read, agree with and accept all of the terms and conditions
contained or expressly referenced in these Terms of Service,
including Shopify’s <a href="&#x2F;legal&#x2F;aup">Acceptable Use Policy</a> (“<strong>AUP</strong>”) and
<a href="&#x2F;legal&#x2F;privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, and, if
applicable, the <a href="&#x2F;legal&#x2F;eu-terms">Supplementary Terms of Service for E.U. Merchants</a> (&quot;<strong>EU Terms</strong>&quot;),

before you may sign up for a Shopify Account or use any Shopify Service.</p><p><strong>Everyday language summaries are provided for convenience only and
appear in bold near each section, but these summaries are not legally
binding. Please read the Terms of Service, including any document
referred to in these Terms of Service, for the complete picture of your
legal requirements. By using Shopify or any Shopify services, you are
agreeing to these terms. Be sure to occasionally
check back for updates.</strong></p></div>

<h2 id="1-account-terms" class="text-t4">1. Account Terms</h2><aside>

<h3 class="text-t5">Which means</h3><p>You are responsible for your Account, the Materials you upload to the
Shopify Service and the operation of your Shopify Store. If you
violate Shopify’s terms of service we may cancel your service access.
If we need to reach you, we will communicate via the Primary Email Address.</p></aside>

<ol>
<li>To access and use the Services, you must register for a Shopify
account (“<strong>Account</strong>”). To complete your Account registration, you
must provide us with your full legal name, business address, phone
number, a valid email address, and any other information indicated
as required. Shopify may reject your application for an Account, or
cancel an existing Account, for any reason, at our sole discretion.</li>
<li>You must be the older of: (i) 18 years, or (ii) at least the age of
majority in the jurisdiction where you reside and from which you
use the Services to open an Account.</li>
<li>You confirm that you are receiving any Services provided by Shopify
for the purposes of carrying on a business activity and not for any
personal, household or family purpose.</li>
<li>You acknowledge that Shopify will use the email address you provide
on opening an Account or as updated by you from time to time as the
primary method for communication with you (“<strong>Primary Email
Address</strong>”). You must monitor the Primary Email Address you provide
to Shopify and your Primary Email Address must be capable of both
sending and receiving messages. Your email communications with
Shopify can only be authenticated if they come from your Primary
Email Address.</li>
<li>You are responsible for keeping your password secure. Shopify
cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your
failure to maintain the security of your Account and password.
We may request additional security measures at any time and reserve
the right to adjust these requirements at our discretion.</li>
<li>Technical support in respect of the Services is only provided to
Shopify Users. Questions about the Terms of Service should be sent
to Shopify Support.</li>
<li>You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or
exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Services, or access
to the Services without the express written permission by Shopify.</li>
<li>You agree not to work around, bypass, or circumvent any of the technical
limitations of the Services, including to process orders outside Shopify’s
Checkout, use any tool to enable features or functionalities that are
otherwise disabled in the Services, or decompile, disassemble or otherwise
reverse engineer the Services.</li>
<li>You agree not to access the Services or monitor any material or
information from the Services using any robot, spider, scraper, or
other automated means.</li>
<li>You understand that your Materials may be transferred unencrypted
and involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b)
changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of
connecting networks or devices. “<strong>Materials</strong>” means Your
Trademarks, copyright content, any products or services you sell
through the Services (including description and price), and any
photos, images, videos, graphics, written content, audio files,
code, information, or other data provided or made available by you
or your affiliates to Shopify or its affiliates.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2-account-activation" class="text-t4">2. Account Activation</h2><aside>

<h3 class="text-t5">Which means</h3><p>Only one person can be the “Store Owner”, usually the person
signing up for the Shopify Service. The Store Owner is
responsible for the Account, is bound by these Terms of
Service and is responsible for the actions of others accessing
the Account. If you sign up on behalf of your employer, your
employer is the Store Owner responsible for your Account.</p><p>We automatically create certain accounts for you to accept
payments. You are responsible for activating and deactivating
these accounts and complying with their terms, which may be with
various third parties, including but not limited to PayPal,
Apple Pay, Google Payment and Shop Pay. Any domain you purchase
through us will automatically renew unless you opt out.</p></aside>

<p><strong>2.1 Store Owner</strong></p><ol>
<li>Subject to Section 2.1.2, the person signing up for the Service by
opening an Account will be the contracting party (“<strong>Store Owner</strong>
”)
for the purposes of our Terms of Service and will be the person who
is authorized to use any corresponding Account we may provide to
the Store Owner in connection with the Service. You are responsible
for ensuring that the name of the Store Owner (including the legal
name of the company that owns the Store, if applicable) is clearly
visible on the Store’s website.</li>
<li>If you are signing up for the Services on behalf of your employer,
your employer will be the Store Owner. If you are signing up for
the Services on behalf of your employer, then you must use your
employer-issued email address and you represent and warrant that
you have the authority to bind your employer to our Terms of
Service.</li>
<li>Your Shopify Store can only be associated with one Store Owner. A
Store Owner may have multiple Shopify Stores. You agree to use
Shopify Checkout for your store. “<strong>Store</strong>” means the online store
(whether hosted by Shopify or on a third party website), or any
storefront built on top of the Storefront API) or physical retail
location(s) associated with the Account.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2.2 Staff Accounts</strong></p><ol>
<li>Based on your Shopify pricing plan, you can create one or more
staff accounts (“<strong>Staff Accounts</strong>”) allowing other people to
access the Account. Each Staff Account must include a full legal
name and a valid email account. With Staff Accounts, the Store
Owner can set permissions and let other people work in their
Account while determining the level of access by Staff Accounts to
specific business information (for example, you can limit Staff
Account access to sales information on the Reports page or prevent
Staff Accounts from changing general store settings).</li>
<li>The Store Owner is responsible for: (a) ensuring its employees,
agents and subcontractors, including via Staff Accounts, comply
with these Terms of Service; and (b) any breach of these Terms of
Service by the Store Owner’s employees, agents or subcontractors.
The Store Owner acknowledges and agrees that Store Owner will be
responsible for the performance of all of its obligations under the
Agreement, regardless of whether it sublicenses or subcontracts any
such obligations to any third party, including but not limited to
any affiliates or subsidiaries of Store Owner.</li>
<li>The Store Owner and the users under Staff Accounts are each
referred to as a “<strong>Shopify User</strong>”.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2.3 PayPal Express Checkout and Shopify Payments Accounts</strong></p><ol>
<li>Upon completion of sign up for the Service, Shopify will create a
PayPal Express Checkout account on your behalf, using your Primary
Email Address. Depending on your location, Shopify may also create
a Shopify Payments account on your behalf.</li>
<li>You acknowledge that PayPal Express Checkout and/or Shopify
Payments will be your default payments gateway(s) and that it is
your sole responsibility as the Store Owner to activate and
maintain these accounts. If you do not wish to keep either of the
payment accounts active, it is your responsibility to deactivate
them. For the avoidance of doubt, PayPal Express Checkout is a
Third Party Service, as defined in Section 9.7.1 of these Terms of
Service.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2.4 Shop Pay</strong></p><ol>
<li>Upon completion of sign up for the Service, if you have been
enrolled in Shopify Payments, Shop Pay will automatically appear as
an accelerated checkout option on your checkout page. If you do not
wish for Shop Pay to appear on your Store, it is your
responsibility to remove it by managing your accelerated checkouts
in your Shopify administrative console.</li>
<li>If your customers have enabled Shop Pay, customers may purchase
goods and services from your Shopify Store using Shop Pay.</li>
<li>By using Shop Pay on your Shopify Store, you agree to be bound by
the <a href="&#x2F;legal&#x2F;shop-pay-merchant-terms">Shop Pay Merchant Terms of Service</a>,
as they may be amended by Shopify from time to time. If Shopify
amends the Shop Pay Merchant Terms of Service, amendments are
effective as of the date of posting. Your continued use of Shop Pay
on your Store after the amended Shop Pay Merchant Terms of Service
are posted constitutes your agreement to, and acceptance of, the
amended Shop Pay Merchant Terms of Service. If you do not agree to
any changes to the Shop Pay Merchant Terms of Service, it is your
responsibility to remove Shop Pay by managing your accelerated
checkouts in your Shopify administrative console.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2.5 Apple Pay for Safari Account</strong></p><ol>
<li>Upon completion of sign up for the Service, Shopify will create an
Apple Pay for Safari (“<strong>Apple Pay</strong>”) account on your behalf,
using the URL(s) and business name associated with your Account.
Depending on your location, Shopify may activate your Apple Pay
account on your behalf, otherwise you will be required to activate
your Apple Pay account within your Account admin. If you do not
wish to keep your Apple Pay account active, it is your
responsibility to deactivate it. For the avoidance of doubt, Apple
Pay is a Third Party Service, as defined in Section 9.7.1 of these
Terms of Service.</li>
<li>If you use an Apple Pay supported payment gateway and your
customers have enabled Apple Pay on their device, customers may
purchase goods and services from your Store using Apple Pay.</li>
<li>By using Apple Pay on your Store, you are agreeing to be bound by
the <a href="&#x2F;legal&#x2F;apple-pay">Apple Pay Platform Web Merchant Terms and Conditions</a>,
as they may be amended by Apple from time to time. If Apple
amends the Apple Pay Platform Web Merchant Terms and Conditions,
the amended and restated version will be posted here:
<a href="https://shopify.com/legal/apple-pay">https://shopify.com/legal/apple-pay</a>. Such amendments to the Apple Pay Platform
Web Merchant Terms are effective as of the date of posting. Your
continued use of Apple Pay on your Store after the amended Apple
Pay Platform Web Merchant Terms are posted constitutes your
agreement to, and acceptance of, the amended Apple Pay Platform Web

process payment of Fees using your payment method. If payment
of Fees is unsuccessful within 28 days of our initial attempt
to process payment, Shopify may freeze your store. You are
responsible for all taxes relating to your Store or use of
the Services. You may be required to remit Taxes to Shopify
or to self-remit to your local taxing authority. No refunds.</p></aside>

Service and/or POS Services (“<strong>Subscription Fees</strong>”) and any other
applicable fees, including but not limited to applicable fees

Fees</strong>”), and any fees relating to your purchase or use of any
products or services such as Shopify Payments, POS Equipment,
shipping, apps, Themes, domain names, Experts Marketplace, or Third

terminated, and any and all outstanding Fees have been paid in
full. Unless otherwise indicated, all Fees and other charges are in
U.S. dollars, and all payments will be in U.S. currency.</li>
<li>Subscription Fees are paid in advance and will be billed in 30 day
intervals (each such date, a “<strong>Billing Date</strong>”). Transaction Fees and
Additional Fees will be charged from time to time at Shopify’s
discretion. You will be charged on each Billing Date for all
outstanding Fees that have not previously been charged. Fees will
appear on an invoice, which will be sent to the Store Owner via the
Primary Email Address provided. As well, an invoice will appear on
the Account page of your Store’s administrative console. Users have
approximately two weeks to bring up and settle any issues with the
billing of Subscription Fees.</li>

Payment Method, we may make subsequent attempts to process payment
using any Authorized Payment Method. If we are unable to successfully
process payment of Fees using an Authorized Payment Method within

to your Account and the Services. Your Account will be reactivated
upon your payment of any outstanding Fees, plus the Fees applicable

in force or enacted in the future (“<strong>Taxes</strong>”).</li>

a result of your subscription to or purchase of Shopify’s products
and services. To the extent that Shopify charges these Taxes, they
are calculated using the tax rates that apply based on the billing
address you provide to us. Such amounts are in addition to the Fees
for such products and services and will be billed to your
Authorized Payment Method. If you are exempt from payment of such
Taxes, you must provide us with evidence of your exemption, which
in some jurisdictions includes an original certificate that
satisfies applicable legal requirements attesting to tax-exempt
status. Tax exemption will only apply from and after the date we
receive evidence satisfactory to Shopify of your exemption. If you
are not charged Taxes by Shopify, you are responsible for
determining if Taxes are payable, and if so, self-remitting Taxes
to the appropriate tax authorities in your jurisdiction.</li>
<li>For the avoidance of doubt, all sums payable by you to Shopify
under these Terms of Service will be paid free and clear of any
deductions or withholdings whatsoever. Other than Taxes charged by
Shopify to you and remitted to the appropriate tax authorities on
your behalf, any deductions or withholdings that are required by
law will be borne by you and paid separately to the relevant
taxation authority. Shopify will be entitled to charge the full
amount of Fees stipulated under these Terms of Service to your
Authorized Payment Method ignoring any such deduction or
withholding that may be required.</li>
<li>You are solely responsible for determining, collecting,
withholding, reporting, and remitting applicable taxes, duties,
fees, surcharges and additional charges that arise from or as a
result of any sale on your Shopify Store or your use of the

problems, contact the designer. Note that Themes may disappear over
time and are subject to change.</p></aside>

<ol>
<li>You may establish the appearance of your Shopify Store with a
design template from Shopify’s Theme Store (a “<strong>Theme</strong>”). If you
download a Theme, you are licensed to use it for a single Store
only. You are free to transfer a Theme to a second one of your own
Stores if you close your first Store. To initiate a transfer of a
Theme to a second one of your Stores, please contact Shopify
Support. You are not permitted to transfer or sell a Theme to any
other person’s Store on Shopify or elsewhere. Multiple Stores
require multiple downloads and each download is subject to the
applicable fee. Shopify gives no assurance that a particular Theme
will remain available for additional downloads.</li>
<li>You may modify the Theme to suit your Store. Shopify may add or
modify the footer in a Theme that refers to Shopify at its
discretion. Shopify may modify the Theme where it contains, in our
sole discretion, an element that violates the Shopify AUP or other
provisions of the Terms of Service, even if you received the Theme
in that condition. Shopify may modify the Theme to reflect
technical changes and updates as required.</li>
<li>The intellectual property rights of the Theme remain the property
of the designer. If you exceed the rights granted by your purchase
of a Theme, the designer may take legal action against you, and,
without prejudice to our other rights or remedies, Shopify may take
administrative action such as modifying your Store or closing your
Store.</li>
<li>Technical support for a Theme is the responsibility of the
designer, and Shopify accepts no responsibility to provide such
support. Shopify may be able to help you contact the designer.</li>
<li>It is the responsibility of the user, and not Shopify, to ensure
that the installation of a new theme does not overwrite or damage
the current or preexisting theme, or UI, of the user.</li>

Acceptable Use Policy, and Privacy Policy), the following terms
apply to your access and use of the Email Services:</p><ol>
<li>Shopify employs certain controls to scan the content of emails you

Scanning</strong>”). Such Content Scanning is intended to limit spam,
phishing, or other malicious content that contravenes these Terms
of Service, or Shopify’s Acceptable Use Policy (collectively,
“<strong>Threats</strong>”). By using the Email Services, you explicitly grant
Shopify the right to employ such Content Scanning. Shopify does not
warrant that the Email Services will be free from Threats, and each
Shopify merchant is responsible for all content generated by their
respective Stores.</li>
<li>BY GENERATING OR SENDING EMAIL THROUGH THE EMAIL SERVICES, YOU
AGREE TO COMPLY WITH THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS (THE “<strong>EMAIL

It is your responsibility to read and understand your obligations

<li>Your use of the Email Services must follow all applicable
guidelines established by Shopify. The guidelines below are
examples of practices that may violate the Email Services
Requirements when generating, or sending emails through the Email
Services:<ol>

recipient has not explicitly granted permission to receive emails
from you by affirmatively opting-in to receive those emails);</li>
<li>using purchased or rented email lists;</li>
<li>using third party email addresses, domain names, or mail servers
without proper permission;</li>
<li>sending emails to non-specific addresses (e.g.,
<a href="mailto:webmaster@domain.com">webmaster@domain.com</a> or <a href="mailto:info@domain.com">info@domain.com</a>);</li>
<li>sending emails that result in an unacceptable number of spam or
UCE complaints (even if the emails themselves are not actually
spam or UCE);</li>

allows the recipient to remove themselves from your mailing list;</li>
<li>failing to comply with any request from a recipient to be removed
from your mailing list within 10 days of receipt of the request;</li>
<li>failing to include in each email a link to the then-current
privacy policy applicable to that email;</li>

<li>failing to include in each email your valid physical mailing
address or a link to that information; or</li>
<li>including “<strong>junk mail,</strong>” “<strong>chain letters,</strong>” “<strong>pyramid schemes,</strong>”
incentives (e.g., coupons, discounts, awards, or other incentives)
or other material in any email that encourages a recipient to
forward the Email to another recipient.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If you or a customer knows of or suspects any violations of the
Email Services Requirements, please notify Shopify at
<a href="mailto:abuse@shopify.com">abuse@shopify.com</a>. Shopify will determine compliance with the
Email Services Requirements in its discretion.</li>

orders from your Shopify Store in the Shop App. If you delete your
Shopify Account, your Materials will be removed from the Shop App.</li>

specialist advice before using or relying on Third Party Services,

Unless we indicate otherwise in our notice (if applicable), any
changes to the Terms of Service will be effective immediately upon
posting of such updated terms at this location. Your continued
access to or use of the Services after we provide such notice, if
applicable, or after we post such updated terms, constitutes your
acceptance of the changes and consent to be bound by the Terms of
Service as amended. If you do not agree to the amended Terms of
Service, you must stop accessing and using the Services.</p></li>
<li><p>Shopify may change the Fees for the Services from
time-to-time. We will provide you with 30 days advanced notice
prior to any changes in Fees by sending an email to the Primary
Email Account, providing notice through the Shopify administrative
console, or by similar means. Shopify will not be liable to you or
to any third party for any modification, price change, suspension
or discontinuance of the Services (or any part thereof).</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="16-general-conditions" class="text-t4">16. General Conditions</h2><ol>
<li><p>The Terms of Service, including the documents it incorporates by
reference, constitute the entire agreement between you and Shopify
and govern your use of the Services and your Account, superseding
any prior agreements between you and Shopify (including, but not
limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service).</p></li>
<li><p>The failure of Shopify to exercise or enforce any right or
provision of the Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of
such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms of Service,
including all terms and conditions and other documents it
incorporates by reference, is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision will be changed
and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the
original provision to the fullest extent allowed by law, and the
remaining provision of the Terms of Service will remain in full
force and effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Save for Shopify and its affiliates, you or anyone accessing
Shopify Services pursuant to these Terms of Service, unless
otherwise provided in these Terms of Service, no person or entity
who is not a party to these Terms of Service will have any right to
enforce any term of these Terms of Service, regardless of whether
such person or entity has been identified by name, as a member of a
class or as answering a particular description. For the avoidance
of doubt, this will not affect the rights of any permitted assignee
or transferee of these Terms.</p></li>
<li><p>The Terms of Service will be governed by and interpreted in
accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of
Canada applicable therein, without regard to principles of
conflicts of laws.</p></li>
<li><p>The Terms of Service may be available in languages other than
English. To the extent of any inconsistencies or conflicts between
these English Terms of Service and Shopify’s Terms of Service
available in another language, the most current English version of
the Terms of Service at <a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/aup">https://www.shopify.com/legal/aup</a> will prevail. Any disputes
arising out of these Terms of Service will be resolved in English
unless otherwise determined by Shopify (acting in its sole
discretion) or as required by applicable law.</p></li>
<li><p>All the terms and provisions of the Terms of Service will be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties to the Terms
of Service and to their respective heirs, successors, permitted
assigns and legal representatives. Shopify will be permitted to
assign these Terms of Service without notice to you or consent from
you. You will have no right to assign or otherwise transfer the
Terms of Service, or any of your rights or obligations hereunder,
to any third party without Shopify’s prior written consent, to be
given or withheld in Shopify’s sole discretion.</p></li>
<li><p>If any provision, or portion of the provision, in these Terms of
Service is, for any reason, held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, then such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability will not affect any other provision (or the
unaffected portion of the provision) of the Terms of Service, and
the Terms of Service will be construed as if such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision, or portion of the provision, had never
been contained within the Terms of Service.</p></li>
<li><p>On termination, all related rights and obligations under the
Terms of Service immediately terminate, except that (a) you will
remain responsible for performing all of your obligations in
connection with transactions entered into before termination and
for any liabilities that accrued before or as a result of
termination; and Sections 1 (Account Terms), 5 (Payment of Fees), 6
(Confidentiality), 7 (Limitation of Liability and Indemnification),
8.1 (Intellectual Property and Your Materials), 9.7(8)-(10) (Third
Party Services, Experts, and Experts Marketplace), 10 (Feedback and
Reviews), 12 (Privacy and Data Protection), 13 (Shopify Contracting
Party), 14 (Cancellation and Termination), 15(1) (Modifications),
and 16 (General Conditions) will survive the termination or
expiration of these Terms of Service.</p></li>

Account Activation\\n\\n\u003caside\u003e\\n\\n### Which means\\n\\nOnly one person can be the “Store Owner”, usually the person\\nsigning up for the Shopify Service. The Store Owner is\\nresponsible for the Account, is bound by these Terms of\\nService and is responsible for the actions of others accessing\\nthe Account. If you sign up on behalf of your employer, your\\nemployer is the Store Owner responsible for your Account.\\n\\nWe automatically create certain accounts for you to accept\\npayments. You are responsible for activating and deactivating\\nthese accounts and complying with their terms, which may be with\\nvarious third parties, including but not limited to PayPal,\\nApple Pay, Google Payment and Shop Pay. Any domain you purchase\\nthrough us will automatically renew unless you opt out.\\n\\n\u003c/aside\u003e\\n\\n**2.1 Store Owner**\\n\\n1.

You are responsible\\n   for ensuring that the name of the Store Owner (including the legal\\n   name of the company that owns the Store, if applicable) is clearly\\n   visible on the Store’s website.\\n2. If you are signing up for the Services on behalf of your employer,\\n   your employer will be the Store Owner. If you are signing up for\\n   the Services on behalf of your employer, then you must use your\\n   employer-issued email address and you represent and warrant that\\n   you have the authority to bind your employer to our Terms of\\n   Service.\\n3. Your Shopify Store can only be associated with one Store Owner. A\\n   Store Owner may have multiple Shopify Stores. You agree to use\\n   Shopify Checkout for your store. “**Store**” means the online store\\n   (whether hosted by Shopify or on a third party website), or any\\n   storefront built on top of the Storefront API) or physical retail\\n   location(s) associated with the Account.\\n\\n**2.2 Staff Accounts**\\n\\n1. Based on your Shopify pricing plan, you can create one or more\\n   staff accounts (“**Staff Accounts**”) allowing other people to\\n   access the Account. Each Staff Account must include a full legal\\n   name and a valid email account. With Staff Accounts, the Store\\n   Owner can set permissions and let other people work in their\\n   Account while determining the level of access by Staff Accounts to\\n   specific business information (for example, you can limit Staff\\n   Account access to sales information on the Reports page or prevent\\n   Staff Accounts from changing general store settings).\\n2. The Store Owner is responsible for: (a) ensuring its employees,\\n   agents and subcontractors, including via Staff Accounts, comply\\n   with these Terms of Service; and (b) any breach of these Terms of\\n   Service by the Store Owner’s employees, agents or subcontractors.\\n   The Store Owner acknowledges and agrees that Store Owner will be\\n   responsible for the performance of all of its obligations under the\\n   Agreement, regardless of whether it sublicenses or subcontracts any\\n   such obligations to any third party, including but not limited to\\n   any affiliates or subsidiaries of Store Owner.\\n3. The Store Owner and the users under Staff Accounts are each\\n   referred to as a “**Shopify User**”.\\n\\n**2.3 PayPal Express Checkout and Shopify Payments Accounts**\\n\\n1. Upon completion of sign up for the Service, Shopify will create a\\n   PayPal Express Checkout account on your behalf, using your Primary\\n   Email Address. Depending on your location, Shopify may also create\\n   a Shopify Payments account on your behalf.\\n2. You acknowledge that PayPal Express Checkout and/or Shopify\\n   Payments will be your default payments gateway(s) and that it is\\n   your sole responsibility as the Store Owner to activate and\\n   maintain these accounts. If you do not wish to keep either of the\\n   payment accounts active, it is your responsibility to deactivate\\n   them. For the avoidance of doubt, PayPal Express Checkout is a\\n   Third Party Service, as defined in Section 9.7.1 of these Terms of\\n   Service.\\n\\n**2.4 Shop Pay**\\n\\n1. Upon completion of sign up for the Service, if you have been\\n   enrolled in Shopify Payments, Shop Pay will automatically appear as\\n   an accelerated checkout option on your checkout page.

If your customers have enabled Shop Pay, customers may purchase\\n   goods and services from your Shopify Store using Shop Pay.\\n3. By using Shop Pay on your Shopify Store, you agree to be bound by\\n   the [Shop Pay Merchant Terms of Service]({{site, url(path: '/legal/shop-pay-merchant-terms')}}),\\n   as they may be amended by Shopify from time to time. If Shopify\\n   amends the Shop Pay Merchant Terms of Service, amendments are\\n   effective as of the date of posting. Your continued use of Shop Pay\\n   on your Store after the amended Shop Pay Merchant Terms of Service\\n   are posted constitutes your agreement to, and acceptance of, the\\n   amended Shop Pay Merchant Terms of Service. If you do not agree to\\n   any changes to the Shop Pay Merchant Terms of Service, it is your\\n   responsibility to remove Shop Pay by managing your accelerated\\n   checkouts in your Shopify administrative console.\\n\\n**2.5 Apple Pay for Safari Account**\\n\\n1. Upon completion of sign up for the Service, Shopify will create an\\n   Apple Pay for Safari (“**Apple Pay**”) account on your behalf,\\n   using the URL(s) and business name associated with your Account.\\n   Depending on your location, Shopify may activate your Apple Pay\\n   account on your behalf, otherwise you will be required to activate\\n   your Apple Pay account within your Account admin. If you do not\\n   wish to keep your Apple Pay account active, it is your\\n   responsibility to deactivate it. For the avoidance of doubt, Apple\\n   Pay is a Third Party Service, as defined in Section 9.7.1 of these\\n   Terms of Service.\\n2. If you use an Apple Pay supported payment gateway and your\\n   customers have enabled Apple Pay on their device, customers may\\n   purchase goods and services from your Store using Apple Pay.\\n3. By using Apple Pay on your Store, you are agreeing to be bound by\\n   the [Apple Pay Platform Web Merchant Terms and Conditions]({{site, url(path: '/legal/apple-pay')}}),\\n   as they may be amended by Apple from time to time. If Apple\\n   amends the Apple Pay Platform Web Merchant Terms and Conditions,\\n   the amended and restated version will be posted here:\\n   \u003chttps://shopify.com/legal/apple-pay\u003e. Such amendments to the Apple Pay Platform\\n   Web Merchant Terms are effective as of the date of posting. Your\\n   continued use of Apple Pay on your Store after the amended Apple\\n   Pay Platform Web Merchant Terms are posted constitutes your\\n   agreement to, and acceptance of, the amended Apple Pay Platform Web\\n   Merchant Terms. If you do not agree to any changes to the Apple Pay\\n   Platform Web Merchant Terms, de-activate your Apple Pay account and\\n   do not continue to use Apple Pay on your Store.\\n\\n**2.6 Google Pay**\\n\\n1. Upon completion of sign up for the Service, if you have been\\n   enrolled in Shopify Payments, Shopify will also create a Google Pay\\n   account on your behalf. If you do not wish to keep your Google Pay\\n   account active, it is your responsibility to deactivate it.

To the extent that Shopify charges these Taxes, they\\n   are calculated using the tax rates that apply based on the billing\\n   address you provide to us. Such amounts are in addition to the Fees\\n   for such products and services and will be billed to your\\n   Authorized Payment Method. If you are exempt from payment of such\\n   Taxes, you must provide us with evidence of your exemption, which\\n   in some jurisdictions includes an original certificate that\\n   satisfies applicable legal requirements attesting to tax-exempt\\n   status.

Term and Termination\\n\\n\u003caside\u003e\\n\\n### Which means\\n\\nTo initiate a termination, you must contact\\n[Support]({{helpUrl}}). Shopify will respond with specific\\ninformation regarding the termination process for your account.\\nOnce termination is confirmed, domains purchased through Shopify\\nwill no longer be automatically renewed. If you cancel in the\\nmiddle of your billing cycle, you’ll have one last email invoice.\\n\\nWe may terminate your account at any time.\\n\\n\u003c/aside\u003e\\n\\n1. The term of these Terms of Service will begin on the date of\\n   your completed registration for use of a Service and continue until\\n   terminated by us or by you, as provided below (the “**Term**”).\\n\\n2. You may cancel your Account and terminate the Terms of Service\\n   at any time by contacting [Shopify Support]({{helpUrl}}) and\\n   then following the specific instructions indicated to you in\\n   Shopify’s response.\\n\\n3. Without limiting any other remedies, we may suspend or terminate\\n   your Account or the Terms of Service for any reason, without notice\\n   and at any time (unless otherwise required by law), including if we\\n   suspect that you (by conviction, settlement, insurance or escrow\\n   investigation, or otherwise) have engaged in fraudulent activity in\\n   connection with the use of the Services. Termination of\\n   the Terms of Service will be without prejudice to any rights or\\n   obligations which arose prior to the date of termination.\\n\\n4. Upon termination of the Services by either party for any reason:\\n\\n   1. Shopify will cease providing you with the Services and you\\n      will no longer be able to access your Account;\\n\\n   2. unless otherwise provided in the Terms of Service, you will\\n      not be entitled to any refunds of any Fees, pro rata or\\n      otherwise;\\n\\n   3. any outstanding balance owed to Shopify for your use of the\\n      Services through the effective date of such termination will\\n      immediately become due and payable in full; and\\n\\n   4. your Shopify Store will be taken offline.\\n\\n5. If you purchased a domain name through Shopify, upon\\n   cancellation your domain will no longer be automatically renewed.\\n   Following termination, it will be your sole responsibility to\\n   handle all matters related to your domain with the domain provider.\\n\\n6. If there are any outstanding Fees owed by you at the date of\\n   termination of the Service, you will receive one final invoice via\\n   email. Once that invoice has been paid in full, you will not be\\n   charged again.\\n\\n## 15. Modifications\\n\\n\u003caside\u003e\\n\\n### Which means\\n\\nIf we make a material change to the Terms of Service that\\nadversely affects your rights under the Terms of Service or your\\nuse of our Services in a material way, we will notify you in\\nadvance (unless the change relates to legal requirements or to\\nprevent abuse of our Services, among other things).\\n\\n\u003c/aside\u003e\\n\\n1. We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to\\n   update or change any portion of the Terms of Service at any time.\\n   We will provide you with reasonable advance notice of changes to\\n   the Terms of Service that materially adversely affect your use of\\n   the Services or your rights under the Terms of Service by sending\\n   an email to the Primary Email Address, providing notice through the\\n   Shopify administrative console, or by similar means. However,\\n   Shopify may make changes that materially adversely affect your use\\n   of the Services or your rights under the Terms of Service at any\\n   time and with immediate effect (i) for legal, regulatory, fraud and\\n   abuse prevention, or security reasons; or (ii) to restrict products\\n   or activities that we deem unsafe, inappropriate, or offensive.\\n   Unless we indicate otherwise in our notice (if applicable), any\\n   changes to the Terms of Service will be effective immediately upon\\n   posting of such updated terms at this location. Your continued\\n   access to or use of the Services after we provide such notice, if\\n   applicable, or after we post such updated terms, constitutes your\\n   acceptance of the changes and consent to be bound by the Terms of\\n   Service as amended. If you do not agree to the amended Terms of\\n   Service, you must stop accessing and using the Services.\\n\\n2. Shopify may change the Fees for the Services from\\n   time-to-time. We will provide you with 30 days advanced notice\\n   prior to any changes in Fees by sending an email to the Primary\\n   Email Account, providing notice through the Shopify administrative\\n   console, or by similar means. Shopify will not be liable to you or\\n   to any third party for any modification, price change, suspension\\n   or discontinuance of the Services (or any part thereof).\\n\\n## 16. General Conditions\\n\\n1. The Terms of Service, including the documents it incorporates by\\n   reference, constitute the entire agreement between you and Shopify\\n   and govern your use of the Services and your Account, superseding\\n   any prior agreements between you and Shopify (including, but not\\n   limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service).\\n\\n2. The failure of Shopify to exercise or enforce any right or\\n   provision of the Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of\\n   such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms of Service,\\n   including all terms and conditions and other documents it\\n   incorporates by reference, is held by a court of competent\\n   jurisdiction to be contrary to law, such provision will be changed\\n   and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the\\n   original provision to the fullest extent allowed by law, and the\\n   remaining provision of the Terms of Service will remain in full\\n   force and effect.\\n\\n3. Save for Shopify and its affiliates, you or anyone accessing\\n   Shopify Services pursuant to these Terms of Service, unless\\n   otherwise provided in these Terms of Service, no person or entity\\n   who is not a party to these Terms of Service will have any right to\\n   enforce any term of these Terms of Service, regardless of whether\\n   such person or entity has been identified by name, as a member of a\\n   class or as answering a particular description. For the avoidance\\n   of doubt, this will not affect the rights of any permitted assignee\\n   or transferee of these Terms.\\n\\n4. The Terms of Service will be governed by and interpreted in\\n   accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of\\n   Canada applicable therein, without regard to principles of\\n   conflicts of laws.\\n\\n5. The Terms of Service may be available in languages other than\\n   English. To the extent of any inconsistencies or conflicts between\\n   these English Terms of Service and Shopify’s Terms of Service\\n   available in another language, the most current English version of\\n   the Terms of Service at https://www.shopify.com/legal/aup will prevail. Any disputes\\n   arising out of these Terms of Service will be resolved in English\\n   unless otherwise determined by Shopify (acting in its sole\\n   discretion) or as required by applicable law.\\n\\n6. All the terms and provisions of the Terms of Service will be\\n   binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties to the Terms\\n   of Service and to their respective heirs, successors, permitted\\n   assigns and legal representatives. Shopify will be permitted to\\n   assign these Terms of Service without notice to you or consent from\\n   you. You will have no right to assign or otherwise transfer the\\n   Terms of Service, or any of your rights or obligations hereunder,\\n   to any third party without Shopify’s prior written consent, to be\\n   given or withheld in Shopify’s sole discretion.\\n\\n7. If any provision, or portion of the provision, in these Terms of\\n   Service is, for any reason, held to be invalid, illegal or\\n   unenforceable in any respect, then such invalidity, illegality or\\n   unenforceability will not affect any other provision (or the\\n   unaffected portion of the provision) of the Terms of Service, and\\n   the Terms of Service will be construed as if such invalid, illegal\\n   or unenforceable provision, or portion of the provision, had never\\n   been contained within the Terms of Service.\\n\\n8. On termination, all related rights and obligations under the\\n   Terms of Service immediately terminate, except that (a) you will\\n   remain responsible for performing all of your obligations in\\n   connection with transactions entered into before termination and\\n   for any liabilities that accrued before or as a result of\\n   termination; and Sections 1 (Account Terms), 5 (Payment of Fees), 6\\n   (Confidentiality), 7 (Limitation of Liability and Indemnification),\\n   8.1 (Intellectual Property and Your Materials), 9.7(8)-(10) (Third\\n   Party Services, Experts, and Experts Marketplace), 10 (Feedback and\\n   Reviews), 12 (Privacy and Data Protection), 13 (Shopify Contracting\\n   Party), 14 (Cancellation and Termination), 15(1) (Modifications),\\n   and 16 (General Conditions) will survive the termination or\\n   expiration of these Terms of Service.\\n\\n---\\n\\nShopify Inc.\u003cbr/\u003e\\n151 O’Connor Street, Ground floor\u003cbr/\u003e\\nOttawa, ON K2P
