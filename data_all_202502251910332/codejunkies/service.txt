However, this does not violate the rule-of-thumb that each new version should be accepted from scratch, without inferring your acceptance from the acceptance of an earlier version. Since no acceptance is inferred from continued use, but only from current use, we rate this as neutral instead of bad.DocumentsCookie PolicyPrivacy PolicyReturn PolicyTerms and ConditionsShipping PolicyAbout Us"Terms of Service; Didn't Read" (short: ToS;DR) is a project started in June 2012 to help fix the "biggest lie on the web": almost no one really reads the terms of service we agree to all the time.APIAboutContactPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseBrandingThanksHelp translatingGermanEnglishSpanishFrenchJapaneseDutchPolishRussianChinese
