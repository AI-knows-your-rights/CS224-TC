state in which you reside.
For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco, California.
Discord and you further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in San Francisco, California to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (referred to as the “JAMS Rules”) and under the rules set forth in these Terms.
If there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms will govern.
ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to your state’s law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Discord will pay the additional cost.
Discord shall also bear the cost of any arbitration fees, unless the arbitrator finds your claims, defenses, or other fee-generating activity to be asserted or conducted for an improper purpose or frivolous.
You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including, without limitation, attorney’s fees and expert witness costs unless Discord is specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law.
The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on Discord and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.
Discord and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, will be allowed in the arbitration.
The arbitrator must follow these Terms of Service and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorney’s fees.
Discord and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, Discord and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.
Discord and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If Discord’s or your claim is solely for monetary relief of $10,000 or less and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, the party bringing the claim may choose whether the arbitration of the claim will be conducted, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the JAMS Rules, solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator.
You or Discord may choose to pursue a claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over you and Discord otherwise qualifies for such small claims court and where the claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief.
However, if you decide to pursue a claim in small claims court, you agree to still provide Discord with advance notice by email to disputes@discord.com and by U.S.
Mail to Discord Inc., 444 De Haro Street #200, San Francisco, CA 94107.&quot;</a></td>

        <td><a title="View more details" href="/points/7306">&quot;DISPUTE RESOLUTION&lt;p&gt; THIS SECTION AND THE NEXT SECTION ONLY APPLIES TO YOU IF YOU ARE A UNITED STATES RESIDENT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY - IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; You and Discord agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Most disputes can be resolved without resorting to arbitration.
In the event of a dispute, you agree to provide us notice of the dispute.
This notice must provide a brief, written description of the dispute, the relief requested and the contact information of the party giving it.
You must send any such notice to Discord by email to disputes@discord.com and by U.S.
Mail to Discord Inc., 444 De Haro Street #200, San Francisco, CA 94107.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with one another, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Site shall not be subject to arbitration, and the notice and good faith negotiation required by this paragraph shall not apply to these types of disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Binding Arbitration.
Except as provided herein, if we cannot resolve a dispute informally, any dispute will be resolved only by binding arbitration to be held in the U.S.
state in which you reside.
For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco, California.
Discord and you further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in San Francisco, California to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (referred to as the “JAMS Rules”) and under the rules set forth in these Terms.
If there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms will govern.
ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to your state’s law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Discord will pay the additional cost.
Discord shall also bear the cost of any arbitration fees, unless the arbitrator finds your claims, defenses, or other fee-generating activity to be asserted or conducted for an improper purpose or frivolous.
You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including, without limitation, attorney’s fees and expert witness costs unless Discord is specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law.
The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on Discord and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.
Discord and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, will be allowed in the arbitration.
The arbitrator must follow these Terms of Service and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorney’s fees.
Discord and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, Discord and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.
Discord and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If Discord’s or your claim is solely for monetary relief of $10,000 or less and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, the party bringing the claim may choose whether the arbitration of the claim will be conducted, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the JAMS Rules, solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; You or Discord may choose to pursue a claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over you and Discord otherwise qualifies for such small claims court and where the claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief.
However, if you decide to pursue a claim in small claims court, you agree to still provide Discord with advance notice by email to disputes@discord.com and by U.S.
Mail to Discord Inc., 444 De Haro Street #200, San Francisco, CA 94107.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Opt-Out Right&lt;/u&gt;.
You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the provisions requiring arbitration by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to Discord by email to arbitration-opt-out@discord.com.
The notice must be sent within 90 days of this Terms of Service taking effect, or your account creation on the Service.
If you do not opt out via this method, you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs.
If you opt out of the provisions requiring arbitration, Discord will not be bound by them either.
If any clause within this Arbitration Section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from this section, and the remainder of its provisions will be given full force and effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Survival&lt;/u&gt;.
This Arbitration section shall survive any termination of your account or the Service.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;</a></td>

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.
BY AGREEING TO BINDING ARBITRATION, YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT AND TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(a) Generally.
In order to expedite and control the cost of disputes, Khan Academy and you agree that any legal or equitable claim, dispute, action or proceeding arising from or related to your use of the Services or these Terms (&quot;&lt;b&gt;Dispute&lt;/b&gt;&quot;) will be resolved as follows to the fullest extent permitted by law:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(b) Notice of Dispute.
In the event of a Dispute, you or Khan Academy must give the other a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and a proposed solution (a &quot;&lt;b&gt;Notice of Dispute&lt;/b&gt;&quot;).
You must send any Notice of Dispute by first class U.S.
Mail to Khan Academy at P.O.
Box 1630, Mountain View, CA 94042 and also via e-mail to notices@khanacademy.org.
Khan Academy will send any Notice of Dispute to you by first class U.S.
Mail to your address if Khan Academy has it, or otherwise to your e-mail address.
You and Khan Academy will attempt in good faith to resolve any Dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent.
After sixty (60) days, you or Khan Academy may commence arbitration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(c) Binding Arbitration.
Any Dispute which has not been resolved by negotiation as provided herein within sixty (60) days or such time period as you and Khan Academy may otherwise agree, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration as described in this Section 15.4.
You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury.
Instead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act.
The place of arbitration shall be Santa Clara County, California.
Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator&#39;s award.&lt;/li&gt;

This requires emailing disputes@discordapp.com a written notice (“Written Notice”), which must include: (1) your name.
(2) the email address or phone number associated with your Discord account.
(3) a detailed description of the issue.
and (4) how you’d like to resolve it.&amp;nbsp.
If the dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Written Notice, you and Discord agree to resolve any remaining dispute through further informal discussions or one of the formal dispute resolution provisions below.&amp;nbsp.
You must engage in this informal resolution process before starting any formal dispute resolution unless exempted by law.
Applicable statutes of limitations and due dates for arbitration filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled upon receipt of the Written Notice to disputes@discordapp.com, while the parties attempt informal resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you reside in the European Union, you may also be entitled to submit your complaint to the European Commission’s Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) Platform or the Out-of-Court Dispute Settlement (“OCDS”) mechanism under DSA Article 21.
ODR allows EU consumers to resolve disputes related to the online purchases of goods and services without going to court.&amp;nbsp.
Note that a submission to the ODR or via the OCDS mechanism alone, without submitting a Written Notice to disputes@discordapp.com, will not toll the applicable statutes of limitations or other deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Governing law and jurisdiction.&lt;/strong&gt; The Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and California law will apply to these terms and any disputes related to these terms or our services, regardless of conflict of laws rules.
Any dispute that is not subject to arbitration will be resolved exclusively in the state or federal courts in San Francisco County, California, and you and Discord both consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in these courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a consumer residing in the European Union, this clause and these terms in general do not affect any mandatory consumer rights you may have under your local law, and all disputes arising in connection with the services and/or these terms shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of Amsterdam, the Netherlands or, if you are a consumer, to a court closer to your domicile if in an EU Member State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Agreement to arbitrate.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍IF YOU’RE A U.S.
RESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS.&amp;nbsp.
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and Discord agree that the U.S.
Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.
Except for the circumstances described below, and only after the parties have engaged in a good-faith, but unsuccessful, effort to resolve the dispute in accordance with the “informal resolution” process (above), you and Discord agree to resolve any dispute, disagreement, or claim relating to these terms or our services through final and binding arbitration in the U.S.
county where you reside.&amp;nbsp.
This includes claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this arbitration agreement or any prior agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this arbitration agreement, in accordance with the notice and opt-out provisions set forth in section.&quot;</a></td>

Arbitration &lt;p&gt;For any dispute you have with Pinterest, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.
If Pinterest has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein.
Unless you and Pinterest agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.
Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, except that Pinterest will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).&quot;</a></td>
