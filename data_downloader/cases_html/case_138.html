Your request must include the following information per Section 512(c)(3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valid contact information for you or a representative authorized to act on your behalf&lt;br&gt; You need to provide information that will allow us and the uploaders of any sets, classes, folders, or other removed content to contact you regarding the complaint.
In general, contact information must include:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Email address&lt;/li&gt;

If multiple copyrighted works are covered in the complaint, the law allows you to include a representative list of such works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each allegedly infringing piece of content’s specific URL&lt;br&gt; You should always include the specific URL of the content believed to infringe on your copyright(s).
General information about the content, such as a folder, search term or username, is usually not sufficient unless also accompanied by a detailed explanation that allows us to identify the content in question clearly and unambiguously (e.g., a statement that all public content created by the user is infringing)&lt;br&gt; In general, however, &lt;strong&gt;submissions should identify content via a specific URL&lt;/strong&gt; in one of the following formats: &lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;www.quizlet.com/#####/xxxxxx&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;www.quizlet.com/class/###### (with an accompanying detailed explanation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;www.quizlet.com/username/folders/xxxxxx (with an accompanying detailed explanation)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must agree to and/or include the following statements: &lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;The information in this notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I am the owner, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The request must include your signature:&lt;br&gt; Complete complaints require your physical or electronic signature or the signature of a representative authorized to act on your behalf.

Any notification by a copyright owner or a person authorized to act on its behalf that fails to comply with requirements of the DMCA shall not be considered sufficient notice and shall not be deemed to confer upon COMPANY actual knowledge of facts or circumstances from which infringing material or acts are evident.
If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send to COMPANY a counter-notice.
All notices and counter notices must meet the then current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA.

DMCA and User Content reporting
&lt;p&gt;The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S.
copyright law.
If you believe in good faith that material available in the Service infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send to Kahoot a written notice by mail or e-mail, requesting that Kahoot removes such material or blocks access to it.
If you believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send to Kahoot a counter-notice.
Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA.
See http://www.copyright.gov/ for details.
Notices and counter-notices must be sent in writing to Asmund Furuseth as follows: By mail to Asmund Furuseth, Kahoot! &quot;</a></td>

Copyright &lt;p&gt;Copyright is a legal right given to authors or creators of original works including literature, music, paintings, films and photos in order to control uses of their works.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S.
copyright law.
If you believe in good faith that materials available on the website infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that we remove the material or block access to it.
If you believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice after we have removed the material.
Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA.
See http://www.copyright.gov/.
Notices and counter-notices should be sent to Company’s Designated Copyright Agent as follows:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Apartment List, Inc.&lt;br&gt;Attn: Copyright Agent&lt;br&gt;475 Brannan Street, Suite 410&lt;br&gt;San Francisco, CA 94107&lt;br&gt;415.817.1068&lt;br&gt;copyright@apartmentlist.com&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
