&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;OUR INFORMATION USE&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We collect information from you and our other users to administer our business activities and to measure and improve our Service.
In addition, information collected from end-users may be used in aggregate form to, among other things, determine the total number of end-users who are using our Service, diagnose and fix compatibility problems or other problems with our Service, and perform statistical analyses to enable us to build higher quality, more useful online services and content.
We may use the information collected from you to show advertising and promotions tailored to your interests.
If you submit a request for information about Among Us through our web site, we may use your e-mail address to assist you with any issues you may have or to send you an e-mail that gives you the opportunity to elect to receive periodic e-mail alerts from Among Us regarding developments at the company.
In addition, if you elect to receive promotional information from Among Us by registering for our newsletter and other notifications, we will use the information you provided to Among Us to send you only promotions that will be most relevant to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may also use your e-mail address to send you important notices.
Because this information is important to your use of our Service, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may combine your Personal Information that we have with other information that we obtain from business partners or other companies.
We may also combine your Personal Information with Non-Personal Information.
If we do so, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In providing our Service to you, we may find it necessary or beneficial to share your information with our partners, including our advertising, services and content partners (collectively, “Partners”) or allow such Partners to gather information directly from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of this information that you provide to us or our Partners may include your Personal Information.
We may share your Personal Information with third parties in certain circumstances including the following situations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consent: We will share Personal Information with third-parties when we have your consent to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partners: We provide your Personal Information to Partners who work with us to provide our&amp;nbsp;Service or&amp;nbsp;provide services outside of and/or unrelated to the Among Us Web Pages or Service.
Our Services with which our Partners may assist us to include among other things, communicating with you about new or existing Among Us or third-party services, creating or maintaining our databases, researching or analyzing our users, or processing payment card information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affiliates: We may share your Personal Information with&amp;nbsp;any and all&amp;nbsp;of our Affiliates.
“Affiliates” means any entity controlled by, controlling, or under common control with Among Us.
Our Affiliates will use and distribute your information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legal Issues:  Among Us will use your Personal Information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
We will also use or share your Personal Information&amp;nbsp;in order to&amp;nbsp;prevent, or take action regarding any illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law even without a subpoena, warrant, or court order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acquisition or Merger: If in the future we sell or transfer our assets or portions of our business, or if we experience a change in control, reorganization or liquidation, we may transfer information to our successor or buyer, subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reserve the right to share your Non-Personal Information publicly and with others.
Examples of public information disclosures include providing anonymous reports to our Partners, such as the number of users who searched for “used cars” or how many users clicked on a&amp;nbsp;particular listing&amp;nbsp;or advertising on our Among Us Web Pages.
In addition, some of the Non-Personal Information is provided to our Partners for uses such as calculating amounts owed by or to such Partners, or helping such Partners improve their services, amongst others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transfers of your information shall&amp;nbsp;at all times&amp;nbsp;be in accordance with applicable law.
Among Us disclaims any liability or obligation&amp;nbsp;as a result of&amp;nbsp;any&amp;nbsp;third-party&amp;nbsp;actions or omissions concerning your information.
We urge you to contact third parties directly with any issues you may have concerning their use of your information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you visit an Among Us Web Page and/or Service, a cookie that uniquely identifies your browser may be sent to your computer or mobile device.
A “cookie” is a small file containing your preferences that are sent to your browser and sent back by your browser each time your browser accesses our servers.
Cookies that we may use may only be read by the server that placed them there.
We use cookies to improve the quality of our Service (for example, by fulfilling your language, filtering and other preferences) and to better understand how people interact with our Service (for example, by tracking user trends and patterns of how people search).
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.
You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
However, some aspects of the Service may not function properly without cookies.
If you would like more information about cookies and how to control and delete cookies in various browsers, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Opera and Chrome, please click here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We currently use the services of web analytics companies to help us measure the effectiveness of our Service, including the advertising on the Service.
To do this, we allow the web analytics companies to include Web beacons and cookies on the Among Us Web Pages.
The type of information collected via such Web beacons and cookies includes search terms, search parameters, click-throughs by users, and other similar information.
By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like user preferences, popular search categories, click-through rates, how to improve our Service, and what kinds of offers our users like to see.
Although our web analytics companies log this information on our behalf, we control how that data may be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most, if not all, of the advertisements appearing on the Service, are delivered to you by one of our Web advertising partners (“Ad Serving Partners”).&amp;nbsp;In the course of&amp;nbsp;delivering such advertisements, our Ad Serving Partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser, or place web beacons, JavaScript or other similar technologies on our Service for the purpose of collecting information.
Thereafter, information about your visits to the Service, such as your search terms or phrases or the number of times you have viewed an advertisement (but not your name, address, or other Personal Information), is used to deliver targeted advertisements to you, a practice commonly known as “behavioral advertising.” The information collected by our Ad Serving Partners through cookies, web beacons or other similar technologies is anonymous, and our Ad Serving Partners are not authorized to collect any Personal Information about you.

&lt;strong&gt;CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recognize our responsibility to protect the Personal Information you entrust to us.&amp;nbsp;Here is how we protect your information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do not use vulnerability scanning and/or scanning to PCI standards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We only provide articles and information.
We never ask for credit card numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do not use Malware Scanning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such&amp;nbsp;systems and&amp;nbsp;are required to keep the information confidential.
In addition, all sensitive information, including credit card if you do provide that to us,&amp;nbsp;is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.&amp;nbsp;We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable law to guard your information.
While we take precautions against possible breaches in our Service and customer databases, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur.
Your use of our Service and the Among Us Web Pages is at your own risk.
We urge you to take steps to protect your Personal Information when you are on the Internet by changing your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure Internet browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;THIRD-PARTY PRACTICES&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When users submit a search query on our Service, Non-Personal Information, such as IP addresses and search terms or phrases, is transmitted to certain Partners with whom Among Us has subcontracted so that those Partners can deliver responsive Internet search results, advertising, or other services and, in some cases, for the internal data reporting purposes of those Partners.
Our Partners are obligated by applicable law to protect the privacy of certain types of data.
however, we are not responsible for their actions or omissions, including the&amp;nbsp;manner in which&amp;nbsp;they use information that they receive from us.
Nevertheless, if you feel that any of our Partners, or any third party who claims association with Among Us, is improperly collecting or using information about you, we urge you to contact them directly&amp;nbsp;and also&amp;nbsp;to inform us by e-mailing us at  Among Us@gmail.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;REGARDING CHILDREN&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;COPPA&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

&lt;strong&gt;YOUR ACCEPTANCE&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In accessing the Service and/or the Among Us Web Pages, you accept all the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.
Accordingly, we ask that you bookmark and periodically review this Privacy Policy to ensure continuing familiarity with the most current version.
If you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this Privacy&amp;nbsp;Policy,&amp;nbsp;we request that you immediately cease using and accessing the Service and/or the Among Us Web Pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;INFORMATION WE COLLECT&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among Us collects information from you in two ways: information you give to us, and information that we gather from your use of our Service,&amp;nbsp;collectively known as&amp;nbsp;“Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII”.&amp;nbsp;PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context.&amp;nbsp;Such information is made up of “Personal Information” and “Non-Personal Information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Personal Information” means information that you provide to us that personally identifies you, such as your first and last name, email address, physical address, telephone number, billing information, or social security number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Non-Personal Information” means information that does not specifically identify you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The information&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; you give to us.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We collect information that you give to us.
For example, as part of our Service, you may elect to provide us with your email address or other information to receive newsletters and other notifications about certain features of our Service.
Such registration may include your disclosure to us of Personal Information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Information we gather from your use of our Service.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, like many websites and applications, collect information about what parts of our Service you use and how you use them.
Information we may gather includes, but is not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computer or browser information such as your system activity, the domain name of the web site from which you linked to our Service and/or the Among Us Web Pages, the time and duration of your use of our Service and any queries, browser type, and browser language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Device information such as your hardware model, operating system, operating system version, mobile device type, unique identifiers from your computer or mobile device, application download information, and/or IP address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location information such as your geolocation when you use our Service from a mobile device and/or mobile application.
We may ask for you to manually provide precise location information or to enable your mobile device to send us precise location information.&lt;/li&gt;

Except as may be required by law, we will not knowingly collect, maintain, or disclose any Personal Information from children under the age of 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not intentionally gather Personal Information about visitors or end-users who are under the age of 13.

&lt;em&gt;Information for Parents&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage parents to spend time online with their children to become familiar with the types of content available on the internet, including the Among Us Web Pages.
Parents should regularly oversee their children’s use of e-mail and other online communications and transactional features.
Control tools are&amp;nbsp;available from online services and software manufacturers that can help provide a safe online environment for kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the Service as a condition of participation.
Parents may request a review and/or removal of their child’s Personal Information at any time by contacting us at  Among Us@gmail.com and providing us with the same screen name, password, and e-mail address that their child submitted.
To protect the child’s privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify the parent’s identity before granting him or her access to the child’s Personal Information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;California Online Privacy Protection Act&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CalOPPA&amp;nbsp;is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.
The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.
– See more at http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to&amp;nbsp;CalOPPA, we agree to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users can visit our site anonymously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our Privacy Policy link includes the word ‘Privacy’ and can easily be found on the page specified above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:&amp;nbsp;On our Privacy Policy Page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can change your personal information:&amp;nbsp;By emailing us&amp;nbsp;or by logging into your account&amp;nbsp;should we&amp;nbsp;provide that feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Fair Information Practices&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.
Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To&amp;nbsp;be in line with Fair Information Practices we will&amp;nbsp;notify you via email within 7 business days&amp;nbsp;should a data breach occur.&amp;nbsp;We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.
This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;CAN-SPAM&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; Act&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We collect your email address&amp;nbsp;in order to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be in accordance with CAN-SPAM, we agree to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at&amp;nbsp;reporting Among Us@gmail.com&amp;nbsp;or follow the instructions at the bottom of each email&amp;nbsp;and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We enable certain third-party advertising exchanges to place advertisements on our sites.
With your consent, those advertising exchanges collect your IP address and/or a unique advertising ID that is used by the advertising exchange to identify you across the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

Unless a failure to comply can be cured promptly, Oracle and Publisher will inform each other if either party (a) has reason to believe it cannot comply with these Terms, including the Rules, or its obligations as a data controller of Personal Information.
or (b) becomes aware of any circumstances or changes in the Rules likely to prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under these Terms, including the Rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;u&gt;End User (data subject) Requests.&lt;/u&gt; Oracle may provide any End User the ability to access, correct, modify, or delete any Publisher Data related to such End User.
If an End User contacts you, you will grant the End User the right, and provide the means, for her to receive a copy of, change, delete or erase, restrict the use of, or obtain, an exportable copy of her Personal Information in accordance with the Rules.
You may also limit or end Oracle’s right to use and share such Publisher Data by notifying Oracle with the specific Publisher Data that must be removed or changed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Publisher Notice and Consent&lt;/u&gt;.
You agree to (a) provide End Users any notices required by the Rules, and (b) obtain End User consent (including opt-in consent), and all necessary End User permissions required for you to use the AddThis Services and to share Publisher Data with Oracle.
Notices and consents must sufficiently inform End Users of the purposes for which Publisher Data is shared with Oracle as described in the Privacy Policy.
&lt;b&gt;YOU MUST NOTIFY AND CONSULT ORACLE (AT daas.marketing.subscriptionmgmt@oracle.com) IF YOU RELY ON A LEGAL BASIS OTHER THAN END USER CONSENT BEFORE USING THE SERVICES OR SHARING PUBLISHER DATA WITH ORACLE&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;You agree to maintain an easily accessible privacy policy linked to conspicuously from your Publisher Site(s).
Your privacy policy links will contain the word &quot;Privacy&quot;, &quot;Data Privacy&quot; and &quot;Cookie&quot; (or their equivalents in the applicable jurisdiction) as may be required by the Rules and Your home page will provide any hyperlinks required under the Rules.
You must also use notice and consent tools on Publisher Site(s) that comply with the Rules (such as banners or overlays), which inform End Users that the Publisher Site(s) uses Cookies and that by visiting Publisher Site(s), End Users are agreeing to your use of Cookies.
Your privacy policy must be easy to understand and provide sufficient details describing (a) what Personal Information you collect and share, (b) the circumstances in which you share it, (c) the purpose(s) for which you share it (including for the purposes specified in the Oracle Privacy Policy), (d) name or type of organization you are sharing it with, and (e) any additional information required under the Rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Opt-out Requirement for Publisher Sites&lt;/u&gt;.
You will maintain appropriate policies and practices that enable End Users to opt out of (i) your collection and your sharing of their Personal Information.
and (ii) Oracle’s use of Publisher Data as permitted by these Terms.
Your privacy policy must allow End Users to opt out of the collection and use of their Personal Information and: (i) for U.S.
facing Publisher Sites, include a link to the DAA opt-out program (currently available at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) or the NAI opt out program (currently available at http://optout.networkadvertising.org).
(ii) for EU/EEA Publisher Sites, insert a link to the EDAA opt-out program (currently available at http://www.youronlinechoices.eu).
or (iii) in any other global region, provide a link to the Oracle Privacy Policy or to an opt-out program or opt-out mechanism compliant with the Rules and, as necessary, ensure that any opt outs exercised through such mechanism shared with Oracle in a way that allows Oracle to quickly process the opt-out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Adherence to Privacy Standards.&lt;/u&gt; You agree that you will not (i) use the AddThis Services to make decisions about an End User’s eligibility for employment, health care, credit or insurance, or for making decisions solely by automatic means where the decision has a significant effect on the End User, or in any way that does or can be used to discriminate against any person or promote bigotry, racism, or harm.
(ii) provide to Oracle any data that qualifies as sensitive data under the Rules.
or (iii) provide to Oracle any data collected from sites directed to children under the age of sixteen (16) or from site users whose age you know to be under sixteen (16).
Oracle may decline to receive Publisher Data at any time.
Both parties agree not to discriminate against consumers who have exercised their deletion, opt-out or access rights in connection with the AddThis Services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Transfers of Personal Information.&lt;/u&gt; You agree that Oracle may transfer and store Publisher Data globally.
Data transfers to Oracle of Personal Information of European Union End Users are made subject to the terms of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses for Controllers (the &quot;&lt;b&gt;Clauses&lt;/b&gt;&quot;) if: (a) Publisher shares, uses, or processes EU End User Personal Information under these Terms.
and (b) such data transfer is: (i)Personal Information subject to any restrictions or requirements under Directive 95/46/EC or Regulation (EU) 2016/679 repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).
and (ii) made to countries, jurisdictions, or recipients outside the EEA or Switzerland not recognized by the European Commission as ensuring an adequate level of protection pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC or the General Data Protection Regulation.
Oracle and you agree that incorporating the Clauses into these Terms is a legally binding execution of the Clauses with you as the data exporter and Oracle as the data importer.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.2 Terms Applicable only to End Users.&lt;/b&gt; If you are an End User this Section 1.2 and certain other parts of these Terms apply to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;b&gt;II.
GENERAL&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;2.1 Warranties and Disclaimers.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;u&gt;2.1.1.
Publisher Warranties.&lt;/u&gt; You warrant that you have the right and authority to grant the licenses in these Terms and that Oracle’s exercise of such rights will not infringe or otherwise violate any End User’s or other third-party rights, and that all so-called moral rights in the Publisher Data have been waived to the full extent allowed by law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;u&gt;2.1.2.
Oracle Warranties and Disclaimers.&lt;/u&gt; Oracle develops its products and services using a commercially reasonable level of care.
However, there are certain promises Oracle does not make about the AddThis Services provided under these terms.
ORACLE PROVIDES THE ADDTHIS SERVICES &quot;AS IS&quot;.
ORACLE DOES NOT MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS OR PROVIDE WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE CONTENT OF THE ADDTHIS SERVICES, THE FUNCTIONS OF THE ADDTHIS SERVICES, OR THE RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY OF THE ADDTHIS SERVICES.
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ORACLE DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES NOT EXPRESSLY INCLUDED IN THESE TERMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;2.2 Term.&lt;/b&gt; Oracle may suspend, terminate, or prohibit your use of the AddThis Services at any time with or without cause.
If Oracle terminates your right to use the AddThis Services, you will stop using the AddThis Services immediately.
If you are a Publisher, you will remove the AddThis Services (and any related code or technology) from all of your Publisher Sites immediately.
The sections of these Terms that by their nature would reasonably be expected to survive will survive termination or expiration of these Terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;2.3 Confidential Information.&lt;/b&gt; Certain content, information, or software you access through the AddThis Services may contain Oracle&#39;s confidential information.
Without limiting the foregoing, all non-public information and materials (including any fee information if you are paying for the AddThis Services) relating to the AddThis Services is Oracle&#39;s confidential information (&quot;&lt;b&gt;Confidential Information&lt;/b&gt;&quot;).
You agree to protect Confidential Information by exercising the necessary care required to prevent its disclosure.
Notwithstanding the above, you will not disclose, divulge, distribute, publish, transmit, or transfer Confidential Information to any third party or use Confidential Information for any purpose whatsoever other than as expressly authorized by these Terms.
Your obligations with respect to Confidential Information, whether or not deemed trade secret under applicable law, remain in effect until the particular information becomes publicly known through no direct or indirect action by you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;2.4 Indemnification.&lt;/b&gt; If you are using the AddThis Services on behalf of a business or other entity, that business or entity accepts these Terms.
You, the business, or entity will hold harmless and indemnify Oracle and its affiliates from any claim, suit, or action arising from or related to your use of the AddThis Services or violation of these Terms, including any liability or expense (e.g.
losses, damages, judgments, litigation costs, and attorneys&#39; fees) arising from such claims, suits, or actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;2.5 Limitation of Liability.&lt;/b&gt; ORACLE WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES INCURRED BY YOU OR YOUR BUSINESS.
ORACLE’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS IS LIMITED TO $1,000.
ORACLE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSSES OR DAMAGES THAT ARE NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;2.6 Export Control Laws.&lt;/b&gt; You acknowledge that the AddThis Services are subject to the U.S.
Export Administration Regulations and other export laws, restrictions, and regulations (collectively, the &quot;Export Laws&quot;) and that you will comply with the Export Laws.
You will not ship, transfer, export, or re-export the AddThis Services, directly or indirectly, to: (a) any countries that are subject to U.S.
export restrictions (currently including, but not necessarily limited to, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Crimea) (each, an &quot;Embargoed Country&quot;), (b) any End User whom you know or have reason to know will utilize them for prohibited purposes, including but not limited to: in the design, development, or production of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons, rocket systems, space launch vehicles and sounding rockets, or unmanned air vehicle systems (each, a &quot;Prohibited Use&quot;), or (c) any End User who has been prohibited from participating in the U.S.
export transactions by any federal agency of the U.S.
government (each, a &quot;Sanctioned Party&quot;).
In addition, you are responsible for complying with any local laws in your jurisdiction which may impact your right to import, export, or use the AddThis Services.
You represent and warrant that (a) you are not a citizen of, or located within, an Embargoed Country, (b) you will not use the AddThis Services for a Prohibited Use, and (c) you are not a Sanctioned Party.
All rights to use the AddThis Services are granted on condition that such rights are forfeited if you fail to comply with any of these Terms.
If Oracle has knowledge that a violation has occurred, Oracle may terminate these Terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;2.7 Miscellaneous.&lt;/b&gt; Oracle may modify these Terms at any time.
You may not assign these Terms, or any part of them, to any other party, without Oracle&#39;s prior written authorization.
You should review these Terms regularly and it is your responsibility to do so.
Oracle will post the &quot;as of date&quot; for these Terms on the bottom of this page.
Any changes to these Terms will not apply retroactively and will become effective for your use of the AddThis Services &lt;b&gt;ten (10) days&lt;/b&gt; after they are posted on this page.
Any changes made to these Terms which are required by law will become effective immediately.
If you do not agree to any change in the Terms, you will stop using the AddThis Services.
Your continued use of the AddThis Services following changes to these Terms represents your acceptance of those changes.
These Terms are the entire agreement between you and Oracle related to the AddThis Services and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements.
