        <h3>You waive your right to a class action.</h3>
        <p>The right to be represented in a class action (or representative action) exists in the US and some European countries. It allows people who have been similarly injured by the same accused to take legal action by a single lawsuit instead of individually. Some Terms of Service try to limit that right. By agreeing to them, you could waive (= renounce to) your right to a class action, which might reduce your chances to be successful in a case.</p>

&lt;p&gt; Discord and you agree to resolve any dispute in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most user concerns can be resolved by use of our Steam support site at https://support.steampowered.com/.
If Valve is unable to resolve your concerns and a dispute remains between you and Valve, this Section explains how the parties have agreed to resolve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOU AND VALVE AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US IN INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION.
THAT INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO: (i) ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US.
(ii) THIS AGREEMENT.
OR (iii) YOUR USE OF STEAM, YOUR ACCOUNT OR THE CONTENT AND SERVICES.
IT APPLIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS ARE BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, UNFAIR COMPETITION, MISREPRESENTATION OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this Section does not apply to the following types of claims or disputes, which you or Valve may bring in any court with jurisdiction: (i) claims of infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, including such claims seeking injunctive relief.
and (ii) claims related to or arising from any alleged unauthorized use, piracy or theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Section does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from us for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a judge or jury.
Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court, and provides more limited discovery.
It follows different rules than court proceedings, and is subject to very limited review by courts.
The arbitrator will issue a written decision and provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND VALVE ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND TO HAVE A TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and Valve agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to informally resolve any dispute before initiating arbitration.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other a written notice that describes the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and sets forth the relief sought.
If you and Valve do not reach an agreement to resolve that claim or dispute within 30 days after the notice is received, you or Valve may commence an arbitration.&quot;</a></td>
