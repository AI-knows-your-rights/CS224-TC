Since the Like button is a little piece of Facebook embedded on another website, the browser is sending information about the request to load Facebook content on that page. We record this information to help personalize your experience on the site and to improve our products.

The data we receive includes your user ID, the website you're visiting, the date and time and other browser-related information. If you’re logged out or don’t have a Facebook account and visit a website with the Like button or another social plugin, your browser sends us a more limited set of information. For example, because you’re not logged into Facebook, you’ll have fewer cookies than someone who's logged in. Like other sites on the Internet, we receive information about the web page you're visiting, the date and time and other browser-related information. We record this information to help us improve our products. As our Privacy Policy indicates, we use cookies to show you ads on and off Facebook.
