If you consent, a licensed Therapist who is employed as part of the <!-- -->BetterHelp<!-- --> Clinical Operations Team may review correspondence with your Therapist for quality assurance purposes. For example, if you raise a concern about your Therapist, or we have concerns about a specific Therapist’s clinical care. In addition, our internal Trust and Safety or Legal teams may review correspondence for specific accounts if we have a reason to believe that there is a security, legal, or fraud issue occurring with that specific account.</div></div><div><div class="font-bold text-site-gray font-[&#x27;Overpass&#x27;] flex teencounseling:font-body"><span class="h-5 w-5 mr-2 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center bg-icon-warning text-white text-[10px]" aria-hidden="true">7</span>Personalize your web or app experience</div><div class="mt-2 mb-7">For example, if you identify as a Member of the LGBTQ+ community and would prefer a Therapist who has relevant expertise, experience, and training to provide therapy services for LGBTQ+ Members, we Process information to allow us to match you with an appropriate Therapist that can meet these needs. Another example is if you state that you would like help with anxiety, we may recommend content and features that would be helpful to you, such as anxiety-related group sessions.</div></div><div><div class="font-bold text-site-gray font-[&#x27;Overpass&#x27;] flex teencounseling:font-body"><span class="h-5 w-5 mr-2 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center bg-icon-warning text-white text-[10px]" aria-hidden="true">8</span>Help us understand how you use our services, how we can improve our products and services to make them more effective and convenient, and offer you new features</div><div class="mt-2 mb-7">For example, we may use some of your data to determine which products and features to roll out, which features are popular and require more investment or resources, or decide to remove features that are not providing value. We may also Process data to know when you have already seen certain notifications on the Platform and do not need to be shown them again. Another example of this is when we use your IP address to help conveniently auto-populate your state (if applicable) and country, or assist you with providing your address when completing information about your emergency contact. We may also track regular usage of certain pages, buttons, or features on the Platform in order to allocate our research and development resources appropriately. In addition, if you opt in to Analytics (previously “Performance cookies”), we may process some data to track site visits across our sister sites such as ReGain and Teen Counseling, and our BetterHelp Business and therapist acquisition web properties. This is known as “first-party cross domain tracking”.</div></div><div><div class="font-bold text-site-gray font-[&#x27;Overpass&#x27;] flex teencounseling:font-body"><span class="h-5 w-5 mr-2 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center bg-icon-warning text-white text-[10px]" aria-hidden="true">9</span>Comply with laws</div><div class="mt-2 mb-7">For example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena. In addition, Therapists are subject to certain legal requirements and professional obligations to have a full record and/or complete information of the care and services they provide you (&quot;Clinical Health Record&quot;), which must be retained for a certain amount of time following the conclusion of your care. This is not unique to <!-- -->BetterHelp<!-- --> and is applicable to in-person therapy as well. Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them. Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that. We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations.</div></div><div><div class="font-bold text-site-gray font-[&#x27;Overpass&#x27;] flex teencounseling:font-body"><span class="h-5 w-5 mr-2 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center bg-icon-warning text-white text-[10px]" aria-hidden="true">10</span>Protect your safety and the safety of others</div><div class="mt-2 mb-7">For example, if we have reason to believe that you or any other person may be in immediate danger or your privacy has been infringed upon, we may use the information to investigate or reach out to you or the appropriate authorities if it is legally appropriate/permitted to do so.</div></div><div><div class="font-bold text-site-gray font-[&#x27;Overpass&#x27;] flex teencounseling:font-body"><span class="h-5 w-5 mr-2 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center bg-icon-warning text-white text-[10px]" aria-hidden="true">11</span>Send opportunities, promotions, news, updates and reminders about our services and your account</div><div class="mt-2 mb-7">For example, we might email you to offer you special promotions or discounts.
