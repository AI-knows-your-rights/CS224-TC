Any potential liability on the part of PICO for any guarantees and for claims based on the German Product Liability Act shall not be affected. The limitation of liability shall apply mutatis mutandis to the benefit of the employees, agents and vicarious agents of PICO.</span><br/><span style="color:#1f2329"><strong>France</strong></span></p><table class="draft-table"><tr><td colSpan="1" rowSpan="1">As a consumer, you have the following statutory rights and guarantees in relation to the Services and Digital Products. PICO will therefore offer you the protection granted by law under the legal warranty of conformity provided by articles L. 224-25-12 to L. 224-25-26 of the French Consumer Code.<br/>Guarantee of conformity<br/>PICO is liable for supplying digital contents and services that comply with the contract with the objective and subjective criteria set out by the law. Regarding one-off supply, PICO is accountable for any non-conformity that exists at the time of supply and becoming apparent within two years of supply. Regarding digital content of service supplied on a continuous basis, PICO is accountable for any non-conformity which becomes apparent during the period in which it is supplied under the contract. PICO is also accountable, within the same time limits, for any non-conformity resulting from the incorrect integration of the digital content or service into the consumer&#x27;s digital environment where this has been done by PICO or under its responsibility, or where the incorrect integration by the consumer is the result of deficiencies in the instructions provided by PICO. <br/>For the 12 month period following the supply of the Services or Digital Product, you will not be required to prove the existence of the defect. <br/>In the event of lack of conformity, you shall be entitled to have the Service or Digital Product brought into conformity or, failing that, to have the price reduced or to cancel the contract, under the below conditions<br/>-Compliance shall be achieved at no cost to you, without undue delay following you request and without significant inconvenience, taking into account the nature of the Service or Digital Product concerned and the use that you intended;<br/>-You shall not be required to pay for the use you made of the Service or Digital Product during the period, prior to termination of the contract, in which that Service or Digital Product was not in conformity.<br/>-You are entitled to a reduction in price or to rescission of the contract in the following cases:<br/>1. Where PICO refuses to bring the digital content or service into conformity;<br/>2. Where the bringing into conformity of the Service or Digital Product is unjustifiably delayed or causes costs or major inconvenience to you;<br/>3. Where the non-conformity of the Service or Digital Product persists despite PICO&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to bring it into conformity;<br/>You shall also be entitled to a price reduction or rescission of the contract where the lack of conformity is so serious as to justify immediate price reduction or rescission of the contract. You are then not obliged to ask for the Service or Digital Product to be brought into conformity beforehand. However, the contract may not be rescinded if the lack of conformity is minor, which is for PICO to demonstrate (this shall not apply to contracts where you do not pay a price).<br/>When you choose to obtain a price reduction or to cancel the contract, you shall inform PICO of your decision to obtain a price reduction. The price reduction shall be proportionate to the difference between the value of the Service or Digital Content provided and the value of that Service or Digital Content in the absence of the lack of conformity.  The refund to the consumer of any sums due by PICO, or any other benefit received under the contract, shall be made without undue delay and at the latest within 14 days from the day on which you inform PICO of your decision to exercise your right to reduce the price or rescind the contract. PICO shall reimburse these sums using the same means of payment as the one you used at the time of the conclusion of the contract, unless you expressly agree otherwise and in any case without any additional cost.</td></tr></table><p></p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p></div>
