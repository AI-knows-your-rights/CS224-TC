# Sentence-BERT (SBERT)

Sentence-BERT (SBERT) is a powerful framework for sentence and text embeddings. It modifies the BERT network using siamese network architecture to generate semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine similarity.

Key features:
- Generates high-quality sentence embeddings
- Computationally efficient for large-scale text similarity tasks  
- Supports multiple languages
- Can be used for text clustering, semantic search and more
